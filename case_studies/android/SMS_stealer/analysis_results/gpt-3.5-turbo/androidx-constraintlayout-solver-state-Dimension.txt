The `Dimension` class in the `androidx.constraintlayout.solver.state` package provides methods for defining and applying dimensions to constraint widgets. It allows specifying fixed dimensions, parent dimensions, percentage dimensions, and wrap content dimensions. The class also allows setting minimum and maximum dimension values, as well as suggesting dimensions. The `apply()` method applies the specified dimensions to a `ConstraintWidget` based on the constraints defined.
