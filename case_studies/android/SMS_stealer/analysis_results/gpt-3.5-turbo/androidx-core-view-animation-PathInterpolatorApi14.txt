The `PathInterpolatorApi14` class is a custom implementation of the `Interpolator` interface in the `android.view.animation` package. It is used to create a smooth animation interpolator based on a specified `Path`.

The class calculates interpolation values based on the X and Y coordinates of points along the `Path`. It uses a binary search algorithm to find the appropriate section of the path for a given interpolation value and calculates the corresponding Y value.

The constructor of the class takes a `Path` as input and initializes the `mX` and `mY` arrays with the X and Y coordinates along the path. The number of coordinates is determined based on the length of the path divided by a predefined precision value.

The `getInterpolation()` method takes a fraction value between 0 and 1 and returns the corresponding interpolated value along the path. It performs the binary search algorithm to find the appropriate section of the path and calculates the interpolated Y value based on the X coordinates and the fraction value.

Overall, the `PathInterpolatorApi14` class provides a way to create custom animation interpolators based on a `Path` using the `Interpolator` interface.
