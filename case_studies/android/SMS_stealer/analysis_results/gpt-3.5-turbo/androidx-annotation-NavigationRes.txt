The code defines the `NavigationRes` annotation in the `androidx.annotation` package. This annotation doesn't have any attributes and can be applied to methods, parameters, fields, and local variables.

The `NavigationRes` annotation is used to indicate that the annotated element represents a navigation resource. It helps in enforcing proper usage of navigation resources and provides additional information to tools and compilers.

The `NavigationRes` annotation has a retention policy of `RetentionPolicy.CLASS`, meaning it is stored in the compiled bytecode but not available at runtime.

This annotation is documented and can be used as a marker for navigation resources in the target project.
