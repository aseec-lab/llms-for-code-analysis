The code in the `SynchronousCall` class provides methods for executing different types of network requests synchronously. It includes methods for executing simple requests, download requests, and upload requests. The code handles different scenarios such as handling response codes, parsing responses, and handling exceptions. It uses the `InternalNetworking` class for performing the actual network requests and `SourceCloseUtil` for closing resources. The result of each request is returned as an `ANResponse` object.
