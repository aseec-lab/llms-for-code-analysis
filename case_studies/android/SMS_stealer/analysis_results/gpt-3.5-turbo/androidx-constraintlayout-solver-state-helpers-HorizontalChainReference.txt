The `HorizontalChainReference` class extends the `ChainReference` class and is used to handle horizontal chain behavior in ConstraintLayout.

Here's a summary of what the code does:

- The class has private fields to store the reference objects for the start-to-start, start-to-end, end-to-start, and end-to-end constraints.
- The constructor takes a State object as a parameter and assigns it to a field.
- The `apply` method is used to apply the horizontal chain behavior to the referenced widgets based on the stored constraint objects.
- The `endToEnd` method is used to set the end-to-end constraint object.
- The `endToStart` method is used to set the end-to-start constraint object.
- The `startToEnd` method is used to set the start-to-end constraint object.
- The `startToStart` method is used to set the start-to-start constraint object.
