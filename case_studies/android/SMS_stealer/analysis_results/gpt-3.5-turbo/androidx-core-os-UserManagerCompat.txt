The code is from the file UserManagerCompat.java in the androidx/core/os package. It provides a static method called isUserUnlocked that checks whether the user is unlocked on the device. 
The method checks the version of the Android SDK using the Build.VERSION.SDK_INT field. If the SDK version is 24 or higher, it uses the getSystemService method of the Context class to get an instance of the UserManager class, and then calls the isUserUnlocked method of the UserManager class. 
If the SDK version is lower than 24, it returns true by default, indicating that the user is considered unlocked.
