The `DatagramSocketWrapper` class is a wrapper class that extends the `Socket` class and is used to wrap a `DatagramSocket` object. It provides a way to create a new `DatagramSocket` instance using a `FileDescriptor`. The class also contains a nested static class `DatagramSocketImplWrapper` that extends `SocketImpl` and is used as the underlying `SocketImpl` implementation for the `DatagramSocketWrapper`. This class overrides various `SocketImpl` methods, throwing `UnsupportedOperationException` for each of them.
