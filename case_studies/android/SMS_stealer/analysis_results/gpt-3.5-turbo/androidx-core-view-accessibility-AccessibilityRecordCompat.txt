The code defines the `AccessibilityRecordCompat` class, which acts as a compatibility wrapper for `AccessibilityRecord` to provide backward compatibility for accessing accessibility record information. It includes methods for obtaining and setting various properties of an accessibility record, such as scroll position, source view, text content, etc. The class also includes methods for recycling the accessibility record and checking if certain properties are enabled or set.This part of the code sets the index of the accessibility record to the specified value using the `setToIndex(int)` method. The `mRecord` variable represents the underlying `AccessibilityRecord` object that this `AccessibilityRecordCompat` wraps.
