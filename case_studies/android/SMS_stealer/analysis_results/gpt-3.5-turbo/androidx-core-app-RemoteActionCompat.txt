The `RemoteActionCompat` class in the `androidx.core.app` package is a utility class that provides compatibility methods for working with remote actions. It implements the `VersionedParcelable` interface.
It has fields to store the action intent, content description, enabled state, icon, title, and boolean value indicating whether the icon should be shown.
The class provides constructors to create instances of `RemoteActionCompat` with different parameters.
There are also getter and setter methods for the fields, as well as a method to convert the `RemoteActionCompat` object to a `RemoteAction` object.
It also includes a static method to create a `RemoteActionCompat` object from a `RemoteAction` object, performing necessary compatibility checks based on the Android SDK version.
