The `KeyCache` class is a utility class for caching float values. 

It has a `map` variable that is a HashMap containing another HashMap with key-value pairs of float arrays. 

The `getFloatValue()` method retrieves a float value from the cache based on the provided object, key, and index. If the object or key is not found in the cache, it returns `Float.NaN` (Not a Number). 

The `setFloatValue()` method stores a float value in the cache based on the provided object, key, index, and value. If the object or key is not found in the cache, it creates a new HashMap and float array to store the value. If the object and key are present, it updates the float array with the new value at the specified index.
