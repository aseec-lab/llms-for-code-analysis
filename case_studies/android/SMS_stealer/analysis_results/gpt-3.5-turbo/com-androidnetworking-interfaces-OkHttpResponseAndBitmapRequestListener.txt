The code defines an interface called `OkHttpResponseAndBitmapRequestListener`, which is a part of the `com.androidnetworking.interfaces` package.

This interface has two methods: `onError` and `onResponse`. The `onError` method is responsible for handling errors that occur during the network request, while the `onResponse` method is responsible for handling the response received from the network request as a bitmap.

Overall, the `OkHttpResponseAndBitmapRequestListener` interface provides a mechanism for handling network request responses as a bitmap.
