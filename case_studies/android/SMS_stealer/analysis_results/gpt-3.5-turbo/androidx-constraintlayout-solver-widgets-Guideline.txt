The Guideline class is a subclass of ConstraintWidget and represents a guideline in a ConstraintLayout. It provides methods for setting the orientation (horizontal or vertical) of the guideline and positioning it relative to its parent container. The guideline can be positioned using one of three methods: specifying a fixed position (begin or end), specifying a percentage position, or inferring the position based on its current position within the parent container. The Guideline class also provides methods for accessing and modifying the constraint anchors associated with the guideline.
