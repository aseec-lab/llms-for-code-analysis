The code represents an enum called `ResponseType` in the `com.androidnetworking.common` package. It defines seven constants: `BITMAP`, `JSON_ARRAY`, `JSON_OBJECT`, `OK_HTTP_RESPONSE`, `PARSED`, `PREFETCH`, and `STRING`. 

There is a static initializer block that sets the values of the constants. The order of initialization is `STRING`, `JSON_OBJECT`, `JSON_ARRAY`, `OK_HTTP_RESPONSE`, `BITMAP`, `PREFETCH`, and `PARSED`. 

The purpose of this enum is to represent different types of response data that can be received from a network request.
