The `WindowCompat` class in the `androidx.core.view` package provides compatibility methods for working with `Window` objects in Android.

The class defines constants for different window features such as action bar, action bar overlay, and action mode overlay.

The class provides a static method `requireViewById` that retrieves a view with the specified ID from the window. On Android versions 28 and higher, it uses the `requireViewById` method from the `Window` class. On lower versions, it uses the `findViewById` method and throws an exception if the view is not found.
