The code defines a `MultipartFileBody` class in the `com.androidnetworking.model` package.

The `MultipartFileBody` class has two public fields: `contentType` and `file`. These fields represent the content type and file of a multipart file body.

The class has a constructor that takes two parameters: `paramFile` and `paramString`. These parameters are used to initialize the `file` and `contentType` fields, respectively.
