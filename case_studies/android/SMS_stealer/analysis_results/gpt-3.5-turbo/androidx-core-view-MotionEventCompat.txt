The `MotionEventCompat` class in the `androidx.core.view` package provides compatibility methods for working with motion events.

It defines constants for various motion event actions, such as hover enter, hover exit, hover move, pointer down, pointer up, and scroll.

It also provides methods for retrieving information from motion events, such as finding the pointer index, getting the action index and action masked, getting the axis value, getting the button state, getting the pointer count and pointer ID, getting the event source, and getting the x and y coordinates of a specific pointer.

Additionally, it provides a method for checking if a motion event is from a specific source.

Overall, the `MotionEventCompat` class helps to handle and retrieve information from motion events in a backward-compatible way.
