The `Protocol` class in the `okhttp3` package is an enumeration of supported HTTP protocols.

Here are the key points of the code:

- The enumeration has constants for HTTP/1.0, HTTP/1.1, HTTP/2, QUIC, and SPDY/3.1.
- There is a private `protocol` field to store the string representation of each protocol.
- The `get` method is used to get the `Protocol` instance corresponding to a given string representation. It throws an `IOException` if an unexpected protocol is provided.
- The `toString` method returns the string representation of the protocol.

Overall, the `Protocol` class provides a convenient way to represent and handle different HTTP protocols.
