The `EventListener` class in the `okhttp3` package is an abstract class that defines a set of callback methods for monitoring events that occur during an HTTP call. It provides empty default implementations for all of its methods, so subclasses can choose to only override the methods they need.

Key features of the `EventListener` class include:
- It defines methods for monitoring various stages of an HTTP call, such as when the call starts, when the request headers are sent, when the response headers are received, and when the call ends.
- It provides methods for monitoring DNS resolution, connection establishment, and secure socket layer (SSL) handshake.
- It also provides methods for monitoring the start and end of request and response bodies.
- It provides a nested `Factory` interface that defines a single method for creating instances of `EventListener`. This allows for creating custom factories for creating `EventListener` instances.

The `EventListener` class is typically used in conjunction with the `OkHttpClient` class, where an instance of a subclass of `EventListener` can be registered to receive callbacks during an HTTP call.
