The `Insets` class in the `androidx.core.graphics` package provides a way to represent insets, which are distances that define the padding or margin of a rectangular area. Here's a summary of the code:

- The class provides constant `NONE`, which represents no insets (all insets are zero).
- The class has four final fields: `bottom`, `left`, `right`, and `top`, which represent the insets on each side.
- The class has a private constructor that initializes the insets.
- The class has a static `of` method that creates and returns an `Insets` object with the specified inset values. If all inset values are zero, it returns the `NONE` constant instead.
- The class also has a static `of` method that takes a `Rect` object and returns an `Insets` object with the corresponding inset values from the `Rect`.
- The class has a `toCompatInsets` method that converts an `android.graphics.Insets` object to an `Insets` object.
- The class has a deprecated `wrap` method that calls `toCompatInsets` method.
- The class overrides the `equals` and `hashCode` methods to compare `Insets` objects based on their inset values.
- The class has a `toPlatformInsets` method that converts the `Insets` object to an `android.graphics.Insets` object.
- The class overrides the `toString` method to provide a string representation of the `Insets` object.
