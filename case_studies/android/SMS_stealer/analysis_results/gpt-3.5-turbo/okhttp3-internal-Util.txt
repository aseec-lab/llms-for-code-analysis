The `Util` class in the `okhttp3.internal` package provides various utility methods for working with network-related operations. It contains methods for handling strings, byte arrays, character sets, time zones, and network addresses. This class also includes methods for closing network resources and checking the validity of input parameters.1. `decodeIpv4Suffix`: This method decodes and validates the IPv4 suffix of an IP address string. It converts the suffix into a byte array and checks if it is a valid IPv4 address.
2. `delimiterOffset`: This method returns the index of the first occurrence of a delimiter character in a string within a given range of indices.
3. `discard`: This method discards a specified number of bytes from a `Source` object within a given time limit.
4. `equal`: This method compares two objects for equality.
5. `format`: This method formats a string using placeholders and returns the formatted string.
6. `hostHeader`: This method returns the host header string for a given `HttpUrl` object.
7. `immutableList`: This method creates an immutable `List` from a variable number of elements or an existing `List` object.
8. `indexOf`: This method searches an array of strings for an element using a comparator and returns the index of the found element.
9. `indexOfControlOrNonAscii`: This method searches a string for the first occurrence of a control or non-ASCII character and returns its index.
10. `inet6AddressToAscii`: This method converts an IPv6 address byte array into its ASCII representation.
11. `intersect`: This method finds the intersection of two arrays of strings using a comparator and returns the common elements.
12. `isAndroidGetsocknameError`: This method checks if an `AssertionError` is caused by an Android-specific error related to the `getsockname` function.
13. `nonEmptyIntersection`: This method checks if two arrays of strings have a non-empty intersection using a comparator.
14. `skipAll`: This method skips all bytes from a `Source` object within a specified time limit.
15. `skipLeadingAsciiWhitespace`: This method skips leading ASCII whitespace characters in a string within a given range of indices and returns the index of the first non-whitespace character.
16. `skipTrailingAsciiWhitespace`: This method skips trailing ASCII whitespace characters in a string within a given range of indices and returns the index of the first non-whitespace character from the end.
17. `threadFactory`: This method creates a `ThreadFactory` that creates threads with a specified name and daemon status.
18. `trimSubstring`: This method trims leading and trailing whitespace characters from a substring of a string.
19. `verifyAsIpAddress`: This method checks if a string is a valid IPv4 or IPv6 address.1. `EMPTY_BYTE_ARRAY`: A constant byte array with length 0.
2. `Util.class`: A utility class that provides various helper methods.
3. Java compiler version: The version of the Java compiler used to compile the source code.
4. JD-Core Version: The version of JD-Core, a Java decompiler, used to decompile the compiled code.
