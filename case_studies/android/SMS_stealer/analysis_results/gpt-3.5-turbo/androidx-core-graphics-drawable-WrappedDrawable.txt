This code defines an interface called `WrappedDrawable` in the `androidx.core.graphics.drawable` package. 

The `WrappedDrawable` interface has two methods:
- `getWrappedDrawable()`: It returns a `Drawable` object that represents the wrapped drawable.
- `setWrappedDrawable(Drawable paramDrawable)`: It sets the wrapped drawable to the specified `Drawable` object.

This interface is used to define the contract for drawable objects that are wrapped by other drawable objects.
