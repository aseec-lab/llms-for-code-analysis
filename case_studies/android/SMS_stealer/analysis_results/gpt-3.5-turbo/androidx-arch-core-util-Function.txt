The code in `Function.java` defines an interface called `Function` in the `androidx.arch.core.util` package.

- The interface has two type parameters, `I` and `O`, representing the input and output types respectively.
- It declares a single method called `apply()`, which takes an input parameter of type `I` and returns a value of type `O`.
- The `apply()` method is used to apply the function to the input and produce the corresponding output.

In summary, the `Function` interface defines a functional interface for representing a function that takes an input and produces an output. It provides a single abstract method for applying the function to the input.
