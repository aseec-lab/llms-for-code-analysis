The code defines an interface called `OkHttpResponseAndJSONObjectRequestListener`, which is a part of the `com.androidnetworking.interfaces` package. 

This interface declares two methods:
1. `onError(ANError paramANError)`: This method is called when an error occurs during the network request. The error information is passed as a parameter of type `ANError`.
2. `onResponse(Response paramResponse, JSONObject paramJSONObject)`: This method is called when the network request is successful. The response data is passed as a parameter of type `Response` and the JSON data is passed as a parameter of type `JSONObject`.

The purpose of this interface is to provide a mechanism for listening to HTTP response events and handling success and error cases.
