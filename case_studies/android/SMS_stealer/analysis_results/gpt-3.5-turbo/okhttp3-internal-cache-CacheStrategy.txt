The `CacheStrategy` class is used to determine the caching strategy for a request. It contains a factory class that calculates various parameters, such as age, freshness lifetime, and conditions, to determine if a response is cacheable. The `CacheStrategy` class also has a static method `isCacheable()` that checks the response code and headers to determine if the response can be cached.
