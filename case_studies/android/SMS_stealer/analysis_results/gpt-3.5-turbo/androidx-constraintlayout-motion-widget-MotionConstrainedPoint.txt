The `MotionConstrainedPoint` class is a class in the `androidx.constraintlayout.motion.widget` package. It represents a point in a motion scene and provides methods to add values to different attributes of the point. 

The class has various attributes such as position, x, y, width, height, and rotation, among others. It also has attributes related to translation, scaling, and rotation in various dimensions. 

The `addValues()` method takes a HashMap of attribute names and corresponding `SplineSet` objects and adds the values based on the attribute to the point. It handles different attribute types such as alpha, elevation, rotation, translation, scaling, and custom attributes.The `MotionConstrainedPoint` class is a class in the `androidx.constraintlayout.motion.widget` package.

The class has various attributes such as position, x, y, width, height, and rotation, among others. It also has attributes related to translation, scaling, and rotation in various dimensions.

The `applyParameters()` method sets the attributes of the point based on the values of a `View` or a `ConstraintSet.Constraint` object.

The `compareTo()` method compares two `MotionConstrainedPoint` objects based on their positions.

The `different()` methods compare two `MotionConstrainedPoint` objects and identify the attributes that are different between them.

The `fillStandard()` method fills an array with the values of the standard attributes of the point.

The `getCustomData()` method retrieves the custom data associated with a specific attribute of the point.

The `getCustomDataCount()` method returns the number of custom data values associated with a specific attribute.

The `hasCustomData()` method checks if the point has custom data associated with a specific attribute.

The `setBounds()` method sets the bounds (x, y, width, and height) of the point based on the parameters.

The `setState()` methods set the state of the point based on a `View` object or a `ConstraintWidget` and a `ConstraintSet`.
