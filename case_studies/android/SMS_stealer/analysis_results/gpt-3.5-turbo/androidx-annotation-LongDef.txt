The code defines the `LongDef` annotation in the `androidx.annotation` package.
The `LongDef` annotation can be applied to other annotations.
It is a sourced retention policy annotation, meaning it is only available in the source code and is not stored in the compiled bytecode.
The annotation contains three properties: `flag`, `open`, and `value`.
The `flag` property is a boolean that defaults to `false`.
The `open` property is a boolean that defaults to `false`.
The `value` property is an array of long values that defaults to an empty array.
