The `CertificatePinner` class in the OkHttp library provides a way to pin certificates when making secure connections. 

Some notable methods and their purposes:

- `pin(Certificate certificate)`: Returns a string representation of a certificate pin using the SHA-256 hash.

- `check(String hostname, List<Certificate> certificateChain)`: Verifies if the given certificate chain matches the pins specified for the given hostname.

- `equals(Object obj)`: Compares two `CertificatePinner` objects for equality based on their pins.

- `hashCode()`: Generates a hash code for the `CertificatePinner` object.

- `Builder`: Provides a builder pattern to construct `CertificatePinner` objects.

- `Pin`: Represents a pinned certificate with its hash and hostname pattern.

Please note that this is just a brief overview of the code, and there may be other important details that are not covered here.
