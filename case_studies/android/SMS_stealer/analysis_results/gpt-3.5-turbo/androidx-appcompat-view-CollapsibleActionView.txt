The `CollapsibleActionView` interface is a deprecated interface in the androidx.appcompat.view package. It declares two methods: `onActionViewCollapsed()` and `onActionViewExpanded()`. These methods are meant to be implemented by classes that want to provide collapsible action views in the application's ActionBar (or Toolbar). 

The purpose of this interface is to allow an action view to notify the ActionBar/Toolbar when it is collapsed or expanded, so that the ActionBar/Toolbar can update its appearance accordingly.

The interface is marked as deprecated, which means that it is no longer recommended for use and may be removed in a future release. Developers are encouraged to find alternative approaches for implementing collapsible action views.
