The `TransitionBuilder` class is a utility class in the AndroidX ConstraintLayout library, specifically in the `motion` package. 

It provides methods for building transitions between different states of a MotionLayout. 

The `buildTransition()` method takes in a `MotionScene`, two constraint set IDs, and two `ConstraintSet` objects as parameters. It creates a new `MotionScene.Transition` object with the specified IDs and sets the start and end `ConstraintSet` objects. 

The `updateConstraintSetInMotionScene()` method updates the `ConstraintSet` objects in a given `MotionScene` to the specified ones based on a given `MotionScene.Transition`. 

The `validate()` method checks if a `MotionLayout` has a valid `MotionScene` associated with it. It verifies that the layout has a current transition and at least one defined transition in the motion scene.
