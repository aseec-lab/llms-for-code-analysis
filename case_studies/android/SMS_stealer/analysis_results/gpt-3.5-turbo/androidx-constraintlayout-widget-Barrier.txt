The Barrier class is a subclass of ConstraintHelper and is used in ConstraintLayout to create a barrier, which is a virtual horizontal or vertical line that widgets can align to. The Barrier class defines various types of barriers, such as LEFT, RIGHT, TOP, BOTTOM, START, and END. The class sets up a Barrier object that uses the ConstraintLayout's solver widgets to handle the barrier functionality. It also provides methods for setting the barrier type, margin, and whether it allows gone widgets.
