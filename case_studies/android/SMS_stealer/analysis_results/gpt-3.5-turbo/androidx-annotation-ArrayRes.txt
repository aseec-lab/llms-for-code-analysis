The code defines the `ArrayRes` annotation in the `androidx.annotation` package. This annotation is used to annotate methods, parameters, fields, and local variables that should only reference array resource IDs.

The `ArrayRes` annotation is documented and has a retention policy of `RetentionPolicy.CLASS`, meaning it is stored in the compiled bytecode but not available at runtime.

The `ArrayRes` annotation can be applied to methods, parameters, fields, and local variables using the `@Target` annotation.

The code does not contain any functional logic. It only defines the `ArrayRes` annotation and its associated target elements.
