The `PopupMenuCompat` class in the `androidx.core.widget` package provides compatibility methods for working with `PopupMenu` on different versions of Android.

The `getDragToOpenListener` method returns an `OnTouchListener` that can be used to enable drag-to-open behavior for a `PopupMenu`. The implementation differs depending on the Android version. On API 19 and above, it calls the `getDragToOpenListener` method of the `PopupMenu` itself. Otherwise, it returns null.

The class also includes a comment with the file location and version information.
