The `PopupMenu` class is a widget that displays a pop-up menu anchored to a specified view. It is part of the AndroidX AppCompat library.

The class has fields and methods to manage the creation and behavior of the pop-up menu.

The pop-up menu is created using a `MenuBuilder` object and displayed using a `MenuPopupHelper` object.

The class provides methods to set the gravity of the pop-up menu, set an onDismiss listener, and set an onMenuItemClickListener.

It also provides methods to inflate a menu resource, get the menu object, and get the menu list view.

The class defines two interfaces: `OnDismissListener`, which is called when the pop-up menu is dismissed, and `OnMenuItemClickListener`, which is called when a menu item is clicked.
