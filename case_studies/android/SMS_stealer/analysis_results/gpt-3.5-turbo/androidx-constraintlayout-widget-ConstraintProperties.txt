The file androidx/constraintlayout/widget/ConstraintProperties.java contains a class called ConstraintProperties. This class is used to manipulate the properties of constraints in a ConstraintLayout. It provides methods for connecting views, setting bias, and centering views within a parent view. The class also defines constants for different types of constraints, such as top, bottom, start, end, and baseline.The remaining code includes methods for setting constraints related to height, width, dimension ratio, elevation, margin, default height, default width, maximum height, maximum width, minimum height, minimum width, bias, chain style, weight, visibility, and rotation.The remaining code includes methods for setting rotationX, rotationY, scaleX, scaleY, transformPivot, transformPivotX, transformPivotY, translation, translationX, translationY, translationZ, verticalBias, verticalChainStyle, verticalWeight, and visibility of a view.
