The `VectorEnabledTintResources` class in the `androidx.appcompat.widget` package extends the `Resources` class and provides support for tinting vector drawables on older Android devices. 

Some key features and functionalities of this class include:
- `sCompatVectorFromResourcesEnabled`: A static boolean flag indicating whether compatibility mode for vector drawables is enabled.
- `mContextRef`: A weak reference to the `Context` object associated with this resources instance.
- `isCompatVectorFromResourcesEnabled()` and `setCompatVectorFromResourcesEnabled()`: Methods to get and set the value of the `sCompatVectorFromResourcesEnabled` flag.
- `shouldBeUsed()`: A method that determines whether vector drawables should be used based on the compatibility flag and the SDK version of the device.
- `getDrawable()`: A method that retrieves a drawable resource, either by using the `ResourceManagerInternal` to load a tinted vector drawable, or by calling the superclass implementation.
- `superGetDrawable()`: A helper method to call the superclass implementation of `getDrawable()`.
