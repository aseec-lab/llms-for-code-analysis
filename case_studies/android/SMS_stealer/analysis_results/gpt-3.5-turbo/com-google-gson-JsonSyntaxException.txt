The `JsonSyntaxException` class is a subclass of `JsonParseException`, which is part of the Gson library. It represents an exception that occurs due to syntax errors in JSON parsing.

The class has three constructors:
1. A constructor that takes a `String` parameter `paramString` and calls the superclass constructor with the same parameter.
2. A constructor that takes a `String` parameter `paramString` and a `Throwable` parameter `paramThrowable`, and calls the superclass constructor with both parameters.
3. A constructor that takes a `Throwable` parameter `paramThrowable` and calls the superclass constructor with the same parameter.

The class also defines a `serialVersionUID` field, which is used for serialization of objects of this class.

The code is located in the file `JsonSyntaxException.java` in the package `com.google.gson`.
