The `RequiresFeature` annotation is used in the `androidx.annotation` package. It is a marker annotation that is documented and has a retention policy of `SOURCE`, meaning it is discarded during compile time and not available for inspection at runtime. It can be applied to types, fields, methods, and constructors. 

The `RequiresFeature` annotation has two attributes:
- `enforcement()` returns a `String` representing the enforcement mechanism for the feature requirement.
- `name()` returns a `String` representing the name of the required feature.

The purpose of this annotation appears to be documenting that a class, field, method, or constructor requires a specific feature, and specifying how the enforcement of the feature requirement is done.
