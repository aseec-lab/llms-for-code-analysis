The `UriCompat` class in the `androidx.core.net` package provides compatibility methods for working with the `Uri` class in Android. The class includes a single method:

1. `toSafeString`: This static method takes a `Uri` object as a parameter and returns a safe string representation of the `Uri`. It checks the scheme of the `Uri` and performs different operations based on the scheme. If the scheme is not `tel`, `sip`, `sms`, `smsto`, `mailto`, `nfc`, `http`, `https`, `ftp`, or `rtsp`, it appends the scheme and a colon to the string representation. Then, it creates a new `StringBuilder` and appends the host, port, and "/..." to the string representation if the scheme is `http`, `https`, `ftp`, or `rtsp`. Finally, it removes characters '-', '@', '.', and 'x' from the scheme-specific part of the `Uri` and returns the resulting string.
