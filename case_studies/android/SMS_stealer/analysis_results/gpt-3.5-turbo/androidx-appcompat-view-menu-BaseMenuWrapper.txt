The `BaseMenuWrapper` class is an abstract class that provides a base implementation for wrapping menu items and submenus in the Android Support Library. 

The class creates a mapping between original `SupportMenuItem` objects and wrapped `MenuItem` objects using a `SimpleArrayMap`. Similarly, it creates a mapping between original `SupportSubMenu` objects and wrapped `SubMenu` objects. 

The class provides methods to get the wrapped menu item and submenu based on the original objects. It also provides methods to clear the mappings, remove menu items or groups, and remove submenus.
