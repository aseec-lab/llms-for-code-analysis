The `BitmapCompat` class provides compatibility methods for working with `Bitmap` objects. 

The class has three static methods:

1. `getAllocationByteCount(Bitmap paramBitmap)`: This method returns the allocated byte count for the given `Bitmap`. It uses the `getAllocationByteCount()` method on devices with API level 19 or higher, and falls back to using the `getByteCount()` method on older devices.

2. `hasMipMap(Bitmap paramBitmap)`: This method returns whether the given `Bitmap` has mipmaps. It uses the `hasMipMap()` method on devices with API level 18 or higher, and returns `false` on older devices.

3. `setHasMipMap(Bitmap paramBitmap, boolean paramBoolean)`: This method sets whether the given `Bitmap` has mipmaps. It uses the `setHasMipMap()` method on devices with API level 18 or higher, and does nothing on older devices.
