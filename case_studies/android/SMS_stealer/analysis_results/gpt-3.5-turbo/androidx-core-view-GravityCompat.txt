The `GravityCompat` class in the `androidx.core.view` package provides compatibility methods for working with gravity values. Here's what the code does:

- The class defines several constants for gravity values, such as `START`, `END`, `RELATIVE_LAYOUT_DIRECTION`, and `RELATIVE_HORIZONTAL_GRAVITY_MASK`.
- The `apply` methods apply a gravity value to a rectangle or a set of rectangles. They check the SDK version and call the appropriate `Gravity.apply` method.
- The `applyDisplay` method applies a gravity value to a pair of rectangles representing display areas. It also checks the SDK version and calls the appropriate method.
- The `getAbsoluteGravity` method returns the absolute gravity value given a gravity and a layout direction. It checks the SDK version and calls the appropriate method or applies a bitwise operation if the SDK version is below 17.

These methods provide a way to work with gravity values in a backward compatible manner, utilizing the appropriate SDK methods if available or falling back to alternative approaches.
