The `DefaultExecutorSupplier` class is a part of the Android Networking library. It implements the `ExecutorSupplier` interface and provides default implementations for executing network tasks.

The class defines three fields: `mImmediateNetworkExecutor`, `mMainThreadExecutor`, and `mNetworkExecutor`. These fields are used to execute immediate network tasks, main thread tasks, and network tasks, respectively.

In the constructor, the class initializes these fields by creating instances of `ANExecutor` and `MainThreadExecutor` with appropriate parameters.

The class also provides three methods: `forImmediateNetworkTasks()`, `forMainThreadTasks()`, and `forNetworkTasks()`, which return the corresponding `mImmediateNetworkExecutor`, `mMainThreadExecutor`, and `mNetworkExecutor` objects.

Overall, the `DefaultExecutorSupplier` class provides a default implementation for executing network tasks in the Android Networking library.
