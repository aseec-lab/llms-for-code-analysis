The code defines the `CheckResult` annotation in the `androidx.annotation` package. This annotation can only be applied to methods.

The `CheckResult` annotation is used to indicate that the return value of the annotated method should be checked by the caller.

The `CheckResult` annotation has a retention policy of `RetentionPolicy.CLASS`, meaning it is stored in the compiled bytecode but not available at runtime.

This annotation is documented and can be used as a marker for methods that return values that should be checked in the target project.
