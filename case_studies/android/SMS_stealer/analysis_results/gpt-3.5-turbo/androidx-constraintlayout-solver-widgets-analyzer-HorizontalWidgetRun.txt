The `HorizontalWidgetRun` class is a subclass of `WidgetRun` that represents the horizontal run of a widget in the ConstraintLayout solver. It handles the positioning and sizing of the widget along the horizontal axis.

The `apply` method determines the behavior of the widget's horizontal dimension based on its constraints. It handles different scenarios such as match constraint, match parent, fixed size, and being part of a chain. It also sets up dependencies between the widget's anchors and the corresponding dependency nodes.

The `applyToWidget` method updates the widget's position based on the resolved value of the start dependency node.

The `update` method is responsible for updating the position of the widget when a dependency changes. It handles different types of runs such as start, end, and center runs.

The `clear` and `reset` methods clear the run's state and resolved values.

The `supportsWrapComputation` method returns whether the run supports wrap content computation. In the case of a match constraint widget, it checks if the default match constraint width is set to zero.

The `toString` method returns a string representation of the run.

In summary, the `HorizontalWidgetRun` class handles the positioning and sizing of a widget along the horizontal axis in ConstraintLayout. It computes the widget's horizontal dimension based on its constraints and updates the widget's position when dependencies change.##########
