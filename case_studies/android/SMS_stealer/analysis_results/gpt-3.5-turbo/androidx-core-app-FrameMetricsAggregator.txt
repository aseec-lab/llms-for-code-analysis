The `FrameMetricsAggregator` class in the `androidx.core.app` package is used to aggregate and collect frame metrics for activities.

Here's a summary of what the code does:

- The class defines constants for various frame metric types and their corresponding indices.
- It has an instance of `FrameMetricsBaseImpl` which is used to handle frame metrics based on the device's SDK version.
- The constructor initializes `mInstance` based on the SDK version of the device.
- The class provides methods to add an activity, get metrics, remove an activity, reset the metrics, and stop tracking the metrics.
- The `FrameMetricsApi24Impl` inner class extends `FrameMetricsBaseImpl` and provides implementation for handling frame metrics on devices with SDK version 24 or higher.
- The inner class uses a handler thread to listen for frame metrics events and adds duration items to the metrics array.
- The `null` inner class implements the `Window.OnFrameMetricsAvailableListener` interface to handle frame metrics availability events.
- The `FrameMetricsBaseImpl` inner class provides empty implementations of the frame metrics handling methods for devices with SDK version below 24.
