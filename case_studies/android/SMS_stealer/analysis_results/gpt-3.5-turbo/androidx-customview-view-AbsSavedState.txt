The code defines an abstract class called AbsSavedState, which implements the Parcelable interface. It provides a mechanism for saving and restoring the state of a custom View.

The class has a final field EMPTY_STATE, which represents an empty saved state.

The class provides constructors to create an instance of AbsSavedState from a Parcel object, with optional ClassLoader parameter. It also provides a constructor to create an instance directly from a Parcelable object.

The class has a private final field mSuperState to store the super state.

The class overrides the describeContents() method to return 0, indicating that the object has no special contents.

The class provides a getter method to retrieve the super state.

The class overrides the writeToParcel() method to write the super state to a Parcel object.

The class also provides a static CREATOR field, which is a Parcelable.Creator object, used to create instances of AbsSavedState from a Parcel object.
