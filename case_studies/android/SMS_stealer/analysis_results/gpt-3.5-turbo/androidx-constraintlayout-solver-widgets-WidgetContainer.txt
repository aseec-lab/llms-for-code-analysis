The WidgetContainer class is a subclass of ConstraintWidget and represents a container that holds multiple ConstraintWidgets. It provides methods to add and remove ConstraintWidgets, retrieve the list of children ConstraintWidgets, layout the children, and reset the container and its children.

Key methods:
- add(ConstraintWidget paramConstraintWidget): Adds a ConstraintWidget to the container by setting its parent and adding it to the children list.
- getChildren(): Returns the list of children ConstraintWidgets.
- layout(): Calls the layout() method on all children ConstraintWidgets, if they are instances of WidgetContainer.
- remove(ConstraintWidget paramConstraintWidget): Removes a ConstraintWidget from the container by removing it from the children list and resetting its state.
- removeAllChildren(): Removes all children ConstraintWidgets from the container.
- reset(): Resets the container by clearing the children list and calling the super class's reset method.
- resetSolverVariables(Cache paramCache): Calls the resetSolverVariables method on all children ConstraintWidgets to reset their solver variables.
- setOffset(int paramInt1, int paramInt2): Sets the offset of the container and its children by calling the setOffset method on each child.

This class provides functionality for managing and manipulating a group of ConstraintWidgets as a container.
