The `FastOutLinearInInterpolator` class extends the `LookupTableInterpolator` class, indicating that it is an interpolator that maps input values to output values. 

The class defines a static array `VALUES` that contains a list of float values ranging from 0.0 to 1.0. 

In the constructor of the class, the `super` keyword is used to call the constructor of the `LookupTableInterpolator` class, passing in the `VALUES` array. This sets the lookup table for the interpolator.

Overall, this class implements an interpolator that provides fast-out and linear-in motion, where the animation starts out quickly and decelerates towards the end.
