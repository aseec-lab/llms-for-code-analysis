The "HttpCodec.java" file in the OkHttp library defines an interface for handling HTTP requests and responses.

The interface has several methods:

- void cancel(): Cancels the HTTP request.
- Sink createRequestBody(Request paramRequest, long paramLong): Creates a Sink object that allows writing the request body to the server.
- void finishRequest(): Finishes the request by closing any resources or streams.
- void flushRequest(): Flushes the request, ensuring that all data has been sent.
- ResponseBody openResponseBody(Response paramResponse): Opens the response body for reading.
- Response.Builder readResponseHeaders(boolean paramBoolean): Reads the response headers.
- void writeRequestHeaders(Request paramRequest): Writes the request headers to the server.
