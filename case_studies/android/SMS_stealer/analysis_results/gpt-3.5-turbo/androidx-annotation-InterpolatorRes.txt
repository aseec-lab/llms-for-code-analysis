The code defines the `InterpolatorRes` annotation in the `androidx.annotation` package. This annotation is used to indicate that a parameter, field, local variable, or method return value should be a resource reference to an interpolator object. The annotation has a retention policy of `RetentionPolicy.CLASS`, meaning it is retained in the compiled bytecode.
