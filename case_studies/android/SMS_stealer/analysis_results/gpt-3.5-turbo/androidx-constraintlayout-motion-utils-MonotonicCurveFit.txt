The `MonotonicCurveFit` class in the `androidx.constraintlayout.motion.utils` package is a curve fitting algorithm that generates a smooth monotonic curve from a set of input data points. It extends the `CurveFit` class.

The class has the following main methods:

- The constructor initializes the `MonotonicCurveFit` with arrays of time points `mT` and corresponding values `mY`.
- The `getPos()` method returns the interpolated y-value at a given x-value.
- The `getSlope()` method returns the slope of the curve at a given x-value.
- The `getPos()` and `getSlope()` methods can accept either a single x-value with an index, or an array of x-values with an array of corresponding output values.

The class also has a `getTimePoints()` method that returns the array of time points used in the curve fit.

The `MonotonicCurveFit` class is used to generate smooth, monotonic curves for motion animations in Android applications.
