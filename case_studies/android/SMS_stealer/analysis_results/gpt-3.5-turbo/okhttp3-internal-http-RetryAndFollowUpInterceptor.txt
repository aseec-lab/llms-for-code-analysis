The `RetryAndFollowUpInterceptor` class is an interceptor in the OkHttp library that handles retries and follow-up requests for HTTP calls. It implements the `Interceptor` interface.

The class has fields such as `callStackTrace`, `canceled`, `client`, `forWebSocket`, and `streamAllocation`.

The constructor takes an `OkHttpClient` object and a boolean flag indicating whether the interceptor is for a WebSocket call.

The class defines methods such as `createAddress`, `followUpRequest`, `isRecoverable`, `recover`, `retryAfter`, `sameConnection`, `cancel`, `intercept`, `isCanceled`, and `streamAllocation`.

The `intercept` method is the main method that performs the interception of the HTTP request. It handles retries and follow-up requests based on the response received. It uses the `RealInterceptorChain` object to proceed with the request and handles exceptions that can occur during the process. The method returns the response received after retries and follow-up requests.

Overall, the `RetryAndFollowUpInterceptor` class provides functionality for handling retries and follow-up requests in OkHttp HTTP calls.
