The DesignTool class in the androidx.constraintlayout.motion.widget package serves as a proxy interface for accessing motion design-related functionalities in the MotionLayout library. It provides methods to interact with motion animations and constraints defined in a MotionScene layout file.

The class maintains references to MotionLayout and MotionScene objects, and provides methods for accessing animation keyframes, animation paths, animation rectangles, and keyframe information. It also allows for disabling auto-transition in MotionLayout.

The class contains various helper methods for setting constraint attributes, dimensions, margins, and bias, as well as for converting between pixel and density-independent pixel (dp) values.

The class also defines a static initialization block that populates HashMaps with predefined attribute and margin values.

Overall, the DesignTool class provides a convenient interface for accessing and manipulating motion-related properties in the MotionLayout library.The remaining part of the code includes methods to:
- Retrieve the start state of the MotionLayout.
- Retrieve the current state of the MotionLayout.
- Get the transition time in milliseconds of the MotionLayout.
- Check if the MotionLayout is currently in transition.
- Set constraint attributes and dimensions for a view.
- Set keyframe for a view in a motion animation.
- Set the position of a keyframe in a motion animation.
- Set keyframe for a view in a motion animation using a parameter.
- Set the state of the MotionLayout.
- Set the position of the tool in the MotionLayout.
- Set the transition between two states in the MotionLayout.
- Set the debug mode for a view in the MotionLayout.
