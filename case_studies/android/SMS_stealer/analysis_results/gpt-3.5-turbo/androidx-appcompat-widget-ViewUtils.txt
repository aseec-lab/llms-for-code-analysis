The `ViewUtils` class in the `androidx.appcompat.widget` package provides utility methods for working with views.

- The class has a static field `sComputeFitSystemWindowsMethod` that holds a reference to the `computeFitSystemWindows` method of the `View` class. This method is used to compute the area that should be available for the application content when the system windows (such as the status bar or navigation bar) change their size or position.

- The class has a static method `computeFitSystemWindows` that invokes the `computeFitSystemWindows` method on a `View` object using reflection. This method is used to adjust the view's padding to fit within the available area for the application content.

- The class has a static method `isLayoutRtl` that checks whether the layout direction of a view is right-to-left (RTL) or not. It uses the `ViewCompat.getLayoutDirection` method to get the layout direction of the view.

- The class has a static method `makeOptionalFitsSystemWindows` that invokes the `makeOptionalFitsSystemWindows` method on a `View` object using reflection. This method is used to specify that the view's fitsSystemWindows behavior is optional.
