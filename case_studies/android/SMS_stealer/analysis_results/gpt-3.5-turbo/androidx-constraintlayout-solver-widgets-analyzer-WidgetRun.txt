The `WidgetRun` class is an abstract class that represents a run of a widget in the ConstraintLayout solver. It contains properties and methods that are common to all types of runs, such as start and end nodes, dimension dependencies, resolved state, and methods for adding targets and resolving dimensions. It also includes abstract methods that must be implemented by subclasses for applying the run, applying changes to the widget, and clearing the run. The class also provides methods for getting the target of a constraint anchor and checking if the run is a center connection or if its dimensions are resolved.The `updateRunStart` method is used to update the run start in the `WidgetRun` class. It takes a `Dependency` parameter but does not have any implementation in the base class.

The `wrapSize` method is used to calculate the size of the run. It takes an integer parameter `paramInt` and returns a long value. If the dimension of the run is resolved, it calculates the size based on the dimension value and the margins. If the run is a center connection, it uses the difference between the start and end margins. Otherwise, it uses the start margin. If the dimension is not resolved, it returns 0.

The `RunType` enum represents the type of a run. It has four possible values: NONE, START, END, and CENTER.
