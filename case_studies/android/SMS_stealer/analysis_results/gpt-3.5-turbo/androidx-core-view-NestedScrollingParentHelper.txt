The code defines a class named `NestedScrollingParentHelper` in the `androidx.core.view` package.

This class provides a helper for nested scrolling parent views.

The class has two private variables `mNestedScrollAxesNonTouch` and `mNestedScrollAxesTouch` to keep track of the nested scroll axes in non-touch and touch modes, respectively.

The class has a constructor that takes a `ViewGroup` parameter but does not perform any specific action.

The class has a `getNestedScrollAxes()` method that returns the combined nested scroll axes for both touch and non-touch modes.

The class has two `onNestedScrollAccepted()` methods, one with three parameters and one with four parameters. These methods are called when a nested scrolling operation is accepted. The methods update the appropriate nested scroll axes variable based on the provided parameters.

The class has two `onStopNestedScroll()` methods, one with one parameter and one with two parameters. These methods are called when a nested scrolling operation is stopped. The methods reset the appropriate nested scroll axes variable based on the provided parameters.
