The `SQLiteCursorCompat` class in the `androidx.core.database.sqlite` package provides compatibility methods for working with SQLiteCursor objects.

Key method and functionality:
- `setFillWindowForwardOnly(SQLiteCursor, boolean)`: Sets whether the cursor should fill its window only in forward direction. It checks the Android version and calls the appropriate method based on the SDK level.
