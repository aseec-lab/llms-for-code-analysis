The `AppCompatRatingBar` class in the `androidx.appcompat.widget` package extends the `RatingBar` class and provides compatibility support for rating bars on older Android devices.

Some key features and functionalities of this class include:
- `mAppCompatProgressBarHelper`: An instance of `AppCompatProgressBarHelper` that provides helper methods for handling progress bar functionality.
- Constructors: The class provides multiple constructors to create instances of `AppCompatRatingBar` with different parameter sets.
- `onMeasure()` method: Overrides the superclass method to measure the dimensions of the rating bar. It also uses the `AppCompatProgressBarHelper` to set the measured dimensions based on the sample tile bitmap and the number of stars in the rating bar.
