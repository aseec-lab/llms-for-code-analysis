This file contains the definition of a Java annotation called `NonParcelField`. This annotation is used to mark fields in a class that should not be serialized/deserialized when using the VersionedParcelable mechanism. The annotation has a `Retention` of `SOURCE`, which means it will not be available at runtime, and a `Target` of `FIELD`, which means it can only be applied to fields.

The file also includes comments that indicate the location and compiler version used to generate the bytecode.
