The `DebugUtils` class in the `androidx.core.util` package provides a static method `buildShortClassTag()` that is used to build a short string representation of a class tag for debugging purposes. 

The method takes an `Object` and a `StringBuilder` as parameters. If the provided object is `null`, the method appends the string "null" to the `StringBuilder`. Otherwise, it retrieves the class name of the object using `getClass()`. If the simple name of the class is not null and not empty, it is appended to the `StringBuilder`. Otherwise, if the simple name is null or empty, the method retrieves the full class name using `getName()` and appends the substring after the last occurrence of '.' character. 

Finally, the method appends the opening curly brace character (`{`) followed by the identity hash code of the object converted to a hexadecimal string.
