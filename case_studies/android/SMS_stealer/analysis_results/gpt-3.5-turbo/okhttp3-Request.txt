The `Request.java` file in the `okhttp3` package defines the `Request` class, which represents an HTTP request. 

Here is a summary of the code:

- The class has private fields for the request body, cache control, headers, method, tag, and URL.
- The constructor initializes the fields with the values provided by a `Builder` object.
- The class provides getter methods for the request body, cache control, headers, method, tag, and URL.
- The `cacheControl()` method parses the cache control headers and returns a `CacheControl` object.
- The `header()` method returns the value of the specified header.
- The `headers()` method returns a `List` of values for the specified header.
- The `isHttps()` method returns true if the URL is an HTTPS URL.
- The `method()` method returns the HTTP method of the request.
- The `tag()` method returns the tag associated with the request.
- The `toString()` method returns a string representation of the request.
- The `url()` method returns the URL of the request.
- The `Builder` class is a builder for creating `Request` objects.
- The `Builder` class provides methods for setting the request method, URL, headers, request body, and tag.
- The `Builder` class also provides methods for creating different types of HTTP requests, such as GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, and PATCH.
- The `Builder` class has a `build()` method that creates a new `Request` object with the provided values.
