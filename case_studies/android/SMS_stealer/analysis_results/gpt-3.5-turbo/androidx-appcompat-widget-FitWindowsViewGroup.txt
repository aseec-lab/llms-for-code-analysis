The `FitWindowsViewGroup` interface is part of the `androidx.appcompat.widget` package. It defines a contract for a ViewGroup that can handle fitting its children within the system windows.

The interface contains a method `setOnFitSystemWindowsListener()` which takes an `OnFitSystemWindowsListener` parameter. It is used to set a listener that will be notified when the system windows are about to change.

The `OnFitSystemWindowsListener` interface is a public static inner interface within `FitWindowsViewGroup`. It defines a single method `onFitSystemWindows()` which takes a `Rect` parameter. This method is called when the system windows are about to change, and the implementing class should update the layout of its children accordingly.
