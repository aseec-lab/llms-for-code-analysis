The `WindowInsetsCompat` class is a utility class for working with window insets in Android applications. It provides methods for accessing and modifying the insets of a window, such as the system window insets, the stable insets, and the display cutout insets.

Some key points about the code:
- The class provides a set of static factory methods for creating `WindowInsetsCompat` objects from `WindowInsets` objects.
- It includes methods for consuming various types of insets, such as display cutout insets and system window insets.
- The class also provides methods for retrieving the values of different types of insets, such as stable insets and system window insets.
- There are methods for checking if the `WindowInsetsCompat` object has insets and if those insets are consumed.
- The class includes a nested `Builder` class for constructing `WindowInsetsCompat` objects with specific insets values.The remaining code provides implementations of the `WindowInsetsCompat` class for different versions of Android. These implementations handle specific versions of the `WindowInsets` class and provide methods for retrieving and consuming different types of insets.

- `Impl20` class is the implementation for Android API 20 and above. It provides methods for retrieving and consuming system window insets and stable insets.

- `Impl21` class extends `Impl20` and adds support for retrieving and consuming stable insets.

- `Impl28` class extends `Impl21` and adds support for retrieving and consuming the display cutout insets.

- `Impl29` class extends `Impl28` and adds support for retrieving and consuming additional types of insets, such as system gesture insets and tappable element insets.

These classes help ensure that the `WindowInsetsCompat` object behaves correctly across different versions of Android.The remaining code provides implementations for the `WindowInsetsCompat` class for different versions of Android.
