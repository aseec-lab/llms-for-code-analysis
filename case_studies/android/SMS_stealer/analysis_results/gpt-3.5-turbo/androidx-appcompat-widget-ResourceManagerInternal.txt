Key Features:
- Manages the caching of drawable resources using a WeakHashMap and LongSparseArray.
- Provides methods for adding delegates for inflating custom layouts.
- Manages the caching of tint lists for theme-based coloring.
- Ensures that vector drawable support is properly set up for the app.
- Provides methods for creating tint filters for coloring drawables.

The implementation includes static variables for caching color filters, a weak hash map for cached drawable resources, a map of delegates for custom layout inflation, and a weak hash map for tint lists based on the context.

The class also includes various helper methods for managing and retrieving cached drawables, adding delegates, caching tint lists, and checking vector drawable setup.

The `get()` method provides a singleton instance of `ResourceManagerInternal`.
