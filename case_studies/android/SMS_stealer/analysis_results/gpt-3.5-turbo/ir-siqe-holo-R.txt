The code defines a class named `R` in the package `ir.siqe.holo`.

Inside the class, there is a nested class `anim` that contains several static final int variables representing animation resources.

There is also another nested class `attr` that contains static final int variables representing attribute resources.

These resources are used to reference various elements such as colors, styles, icons, and dimensions in the application layout and behavior. They are accessed by other parts of the application to apply styles, set properties, and display content.
