The `WrappedDrawableApi21` class in the `androidx.core.graphics.drawable` package is a subclass of `WrappedDrawableApi14` that provides additional functionality specific to API level 21 and above.

Here's a summary of the code:

- The class extends the `WrappedDrawableApi14` class, which itself extends `Drawable` and provides support for wrapping another drawable.
- The constructor takes a `Drawable` object as a parameter and calls the superclass constructor with this parameter.
- The `findAndCacheIsProjectedDrawableMethod` method checks if the `isProjected` method is available on the `Drawable` class using reflection and caches the method for future use.
- The `getDirtyBounds` method returns the dirty bounds of the drawable.
- The `getOutline` method forwards the call to the wrapped drawable to get its outline.
- The `isCompatTintEnabled` method checks if compatibility tinting is enabled for the drawable based on the API level and the type of drawable.
- The `isProjected` method calls the `isProjected` method on the wrapped drawable using reflection, if available.
- The `setHotspot` method sets the hotspot of the drawable.
- The `setHotspotBounds` method sets the bounds of the hotspot on the drawable.
- The `setState` method calls the `setState` method on the wrapped drawable and invalidates the drawable if the state changes.
- The `setTint`, `setTintList`, and `setTintMode` methods apply tinting to the drawable based on compatibility and the API level.

This class primarily provides compatibility support for API level 21 and above and delegates most of the functionality to the wrapped drawable.
