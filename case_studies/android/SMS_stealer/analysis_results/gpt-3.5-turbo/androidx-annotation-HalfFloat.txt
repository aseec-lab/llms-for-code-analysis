The code defines the `HalfFloat` annotation in the `androidx.annotation` package. This annotation is used to annotate parameters, methods, local variables, and fields that represent half-precision floating-point values. The annotation has a retention policy of `RetentionPolicy.SOURCE`, meaning it is only retained in the source code and not at runtime.
