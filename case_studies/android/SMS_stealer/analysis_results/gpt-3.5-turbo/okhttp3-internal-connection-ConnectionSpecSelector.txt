The `ConnectionSpecSelector` class is responsible for selecting the appropriate `ConnectionSpec` for establishing a secure connection with an SSLSocket.

The class has the following fields:
- `connectionSpecs`: A list of `ConnectionSpec` objects.
- `isFallback`: A boolean flag indicating whether a fallback connection is possible.
- `isFallbackPossible`: A boolean flag indicating whether a fallback connection is possible.
- `nextModeIndex`: An integer representing the index of the next `ConnectionSpec` to be checked.

The class has the following methods:
- `ConnectionSpecSelector(List<ConnectionSpec> connectionSpecs)`: Constructor that initializes the `connectionSpecs` field with the provided list of `ConnectionSpec` objects.
- `isFallbackPossible(SSLSocket paramSSLSocket)`: Checks whether a fallback connection is possible for the given SSLSocket.
- `configureSecureSocket(SSLSocket paramSSLSocket)`: Configures the secure socket by selecting the appropriate `ConnectionSpec` and applying it using the `Internal.instance.apply()` method. Returns the selected `ConnectionSpec`.
- `connectionFailed(IOException paramIOException)`: Handles connection failures by determining if a fallback connection should be attempted. Returns a boolean value indicating whether a fallback connection is possible.
