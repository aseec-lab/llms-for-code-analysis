The code defines the `AnimRes` annotation in the `androidx.annotation` package.
The `AnimRes` annotation can be applied to methods, parameters, fields, and local variables.
It is a documented annotation with a retention policy of `RetentionPolicy.CLASS`, meaning it is stored in the compiled bytecode but not available at runtime.
This annotation does not contain any elements or properties.
