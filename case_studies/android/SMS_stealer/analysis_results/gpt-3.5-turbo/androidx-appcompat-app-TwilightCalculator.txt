The code defines the `TwilightCalculator` class.

Here's a summary of what this code does:

1. The class calculates the twilight times (sunrise and sunset) based on the provided parameters.
2. It contains constants and formulas for the calculations.
3. The `getInstance` method returns an instance of the `TwilightCalculator` class. If an instance does not exist, it creates a new one.
4. The `calculateTwilight` method performs the actual calculations based on the input parameters.
5. The calculated sunrise and sunset values are stored in the `sunrise` and `sunset` variables respectively.
6. The `state` variable indicates whether it is day or night based on the calculated values.
7. The code comments at the end specify the location, Java compiler version, and JD-Core version of the class.
