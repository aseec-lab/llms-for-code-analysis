The code defines the `StyleableRes` annotation in the `androidx.annotation` package. This annotation is used to indicate that a method, parameter, field, or local variable refers to a styleable resource. The annotation has a retention policy of `RetentionPolicy.CLASS`, meaning it is retained in the compiled bytecode.
