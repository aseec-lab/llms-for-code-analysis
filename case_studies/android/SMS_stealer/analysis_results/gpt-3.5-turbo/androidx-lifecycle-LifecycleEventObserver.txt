The `LifecycleEventObserver` interface is part of the `androidx.lifecycle` package. It extends the `LifecycleObserver` interface and defines a method called `onStateChanged()`. This method is responsible for handling changes in the lifecycle state of a `LifecycleOwner` object.

The `onStateChanged()` method takes two parameters: `paramLifecycleOwner`, which represents the lifecycle owner that had a state change, and `paramEvent`, which represents the specific event that occurred in the lifecycle.

The purpose of this interface is to allow classes that implement it to observe and handle lifecycle events of a `LifecycleOwner` object. By implementing this interface, a class can receive notifications whenever a lifecycle event occurs and perform any necessary actions based on the event.

The code follows the standard Java naming conventions for interfaces, with the use of a prefix "Lifecycle" and the suffix "Observer" to indicate its purpose.

The code does not provide any implementation details or logic for handling lifecycle events. It only defines the method signature that should be implemented by classes that need to observe lifecycle events.
