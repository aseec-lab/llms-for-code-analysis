The code defines the `StyleRes` annotation in the `androidx.annotation` package. This annotation is used to indicate that a method, parameter, field, or local variable should be a reference to a style resource.

The `StyleRes` annotation can be applied to methods, parameters, fields, and local variables, as specified by the `@Target` annotation.

The `StyleRes` annotation has a retention policy of `RetentionPolicy.CLASS`, meaning it is stored in the compiled bytecode but not available at runtime.

The `StyleRes` annotation does not have any attributes.
