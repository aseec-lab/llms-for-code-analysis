The code defines the `ActionMenuItem` class, which implements the `SupportMenuItem` interface and represents a menu item in the appcompat library. It provides methods to set and retrieve properties of the menu item, such as its icon, visibility, shortcuts, and action views, as well as handle actions related to the menu item, such as invoking the associated action and expanding/collapsing action views.The remaining part of the code provides various setters for properties of the `ActionMenuItem` class. These setters include:

- `setExclusiveCheckable`: sets whether the menu item should be exclusively checkable.
- `setIcon`: sets the icon for the menu item, either by a resource ID or a `Drawable` object.
- `setIconTintList`: sets the color state list for tinting the icon.
- `setIconTintMode`: sets the PorterDuff mode for tinting the icon.
- `setIntent`: sets the intent associated with the menu item.
- `setNumericShortcut`: sets the numeric shortcut key for the menu item.
- `setOnMenuItemClickListener`: sets the click listener for the menu item.
- `setShortcut`: sets the shortcut keys for the menu item.
- `setShowAsActionFlags`: sets the show as action flags for the menu item.
- `setSupportActionProvider`: sets the action provider for the menu item.
- `setTitle`: sets the title for the menu item, either by a string resource ID or a `CharSequence` object.
- `setTitleCondensed`: sets the condensed title for the menu item.
- `setTooltipText`: sets the tooltip text for the menu item.
- `setVisible`: sets the visibility of the menu item.

Some of the methods throw `UnsupportedOperationException` as they are not supported in the `ActionMenuItem` class.
