The `BufferedSink` interface in the `okio` package provides methods for writing data to an underlying sink. It extends the `Sink` interface and the `WritableByteChannel` interface.

- The `buffer()` method returns the buffer associated with the sink.
- The `emit()` method flushes any buffered data to the underlying sink.
- The `emitCompleteSegments()` method flushes any complete segments of buffered data to the underlying sink.
- The `flush()` method flushes any buffered data to the underlying sink.
- The `outputStream()` method returns an `OutputStream` that writes to the underlying sink.
- The `write(ByteString)` method writes a `ByteString` to the sink.
- The `write(Source, long)` method writes data from a `Source` to the sink for a specified length.
- The `write(byte[])` method writes a byte array to the sink.
- The `write(byte[], int, int)` method writes a portion of a byte array to the sink.
- The `writeAll(Source)` method writes all data from a `Source` to the sink.
- The `writeByte(int)` method writes a single byte to the sink.
- The `writeDecimalLong(long)` method writes a decimal representation of a `long` value to the sink.
- The `writeHexadecimalUnsignedLong(long)` method writes a hexadecimal representation of an unsigned `long` value to the sink.
- The `writeInt(int)` method writes an integer value to the sink.
- The `writeIntLe(int)` method writes an integer value in little-endian order to the sink.
- The `writeLong(long)` method writes a `long` value to the sink.
- The `writeLongLe(long)` method writes a `long` value in little-endian order to the sink.
- The `writeShort(int)` method writes a short value to the sink.
- The `writeShortLe(int)` method writes a short value in little-endian order to the sink.
- The `writeString(String, int, int, Charset)` method writes a portion of a string to the sink using the specified character set.
- The `writeString(String, Charset)` method writes a string to the sink using the specified character set.
- The `writeUtf8(String)` method writes a UTF-8 encoded string to the sink.
- The `writeUtf8(String, int, int)` method writes a portion of a UTF-8 encoded string to the sink.
- The `writeUtf8CodePoint(int)` method writes a UTF-8 encoded code point to the sink.
