The `Http2Codec` class is responsible for handling HTTP/2 communication. It implements the `HttpCodec` interface and contains methods for reading and writing request and response headers, creating request bodies, and handling the HTTP/2 stream. It uses the `okhttp3.internal.http2.Http2Connection` class to establish and maintain the HTTP/2 connection, and the `okhttp3.internal.connection.StreamAllocation` class to allocate streams on the connection. This class also provides methods for canceling the request and opening the response body.
