The `BundleCompat` class in the `androidx.core.app` package is a utility class that provides compatibility methods for working with `Bundle` objects. 

It includes methods for getting and putting `IBinder` objects in a `Bundle`, with compatibility checks based on the Android SDK version. 

The class also includes a nested class `BundleCompatBaseImpl` that uses reflection to access the `getIBinder` and `putIBinder` methods on older versions of Android where these methods are not available directly.
