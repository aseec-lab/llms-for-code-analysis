The `AppCompatRadioButton` class in the `androidx.appcompat.widget` package extends the `RadioButton` class and implements the `TintableCompoundButton` and `TintableBackgroundView` interfaces.

- It has three private fields: `mBackgroundTintHelper` of type `AppCompatBackgroundHelper`, `mCompoundButtonHelper` of type `AppCompatCompoundButtonHelper`, and `mTextHelper` of type `AppCompatTextHelper`.
- It has three constructors that call the super constructor and initialize the helper classes.
- It overrides the `drawableStateChanged` method to apply the background tint and compound drawables tints when the drawable state changes.
- It overrides the `getCompoundPaddingLeft` method to adjust the padding on the left side of the compound button.
- It provides getters and setters for the support background tint and button tint.
- It overrides the `setBackgroundDrawable` and `setBackgroundResource` methods to set the background drawable and resource, and apply the background tint if present.
- It overrides the `setButtonDrawable` method to set the button drawable and update the button tint if present.
- It provides setters for the support background tint and button tint.
- The implementation of these methods delegates the functionality to the helper classes (`mBackgroundTintHelper` and `mCompoundButtonHelper`).
