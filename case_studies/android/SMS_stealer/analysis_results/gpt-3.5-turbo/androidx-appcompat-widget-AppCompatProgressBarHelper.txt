The `AppCompatProgressBarHelper` class is used to provide compatibility support for styling `ProgressBar` widgets in the AppCompat theme. It extends the `AppCompatProgressBarHelper` class and overrides several methods to handle the styling of the progress bar.

The class contains a constant array of tint attributes and a `Bitmap` field to store a sample tile bitmap. The main constructor takes a `ProgressBar` object as input.

The class provides methods to obtain the drawable shape, tileify drawables (including the indeterminate drawable), and get the sample tile bitmap. It also provides a method to load attributes from an attribute set.

The `tileify` method recursively converts a drawable into a `ClipDrawable` or `LayerDrawable` with tiled repetition, and optionally applies a shape drawable if the drawable is a `BitmapDrawable`. This method is used to apply tiling and shape to the progress bar drawables.

The `tileifyIndeterminate` method is similar to `tileify`, but specifically handles animated drawables, such as `AnimationDrawable`, for indeterminate progress bars.

Overall, the `AppCompatProgressBarHelper` class assists in applying styling and compatibility support to `ProgressBar` widgets in the AppCompat theme.
