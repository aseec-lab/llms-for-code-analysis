The code defines the `FragmentTransaction` abstract class, which represents a transaction to perform operations on fragments. It provides methods to add, attach, detach, hide, remove, replace, and show fragments within a transaction. The transaction can also be added to the back stack and executed with custom animations. The class maintains a list of operations (`Op`) to be executed in the transaction. The operations are defined by constants such as `OP_ADD`, `OP_ATTACH`, `OP_DETACH`, `OP_HIDE`, `OP_REMOVE`, `OP_REPLACE`, etc. It also provides methods to set breadcrumb title and subtitle, and to add shared elements in a transition. The transaction can be committed synchronously or asynchronously, and it supports optimization and reordering of operations.The code defines the remaining methods of the `FragmentTransaction` class. These methods include setting the maximum lifecycle state of a fragment, setting the primary navigation fragment, setting reordering allowed flag, setting the transition animation, setting the transition style, and showing a fragment. 

The code also includes the definition of the `Op` class, which represents an operation to be performed in a fragment transaction. It includes fields for the command type, fragment, animation properties, and maximum lifecycle state.
