The `Size` annotation is defined in the `androidx.annotation` package. It is used to annotate methods, parameters, fields, and local variables.

The `Size` annotation has a retention policy of `RetentionPolicy.CLASS`, meaning it is retained in the compiled bytecode but not available at runtime.

The `Size` annotation has the following attributes:
- `max()`: sets the maximum value of the annotated element (default is Long.MAX_VALUE).
- `min()`: sets the minimum value of the annotated element (default is Long.MIN_VALUE).
- `multiple()`: sets the multiple of the annotated element's value (default is 1).
- `value()`: sets the value of the annotated element (default is -1).

This annotation is used to specify size-related constraints on the annotated element.
