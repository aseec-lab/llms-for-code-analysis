The `GestureDetectorCompat` class in the `androidx.core.view` package provides compatibility for working with the `GestureDetector` class on different versions of Android. It includes methods for handling touch events, enabling/disabling long press, and setting double tap listeners.

The class has an inner interface `GestureDetectorCompatImpl` and an inner class `GestureDetectorCompatImplBase` that provide implementation for the compatibility methods.

The constructor of `GestureDetectorCompat` creates an instance of the appropriate implementation based on the Android version. The `onTouchEvent` method dispatches touch events to the underlying implementation. Other methods such as `isLongpressEnabled`, `setIsLongpressEnabled`, and `setOnDoubleTapListener` delegate to the underlying implementation as well.

Overall, `GestureDetectorCompat` provides a wrapper around the `GestureDetector` class to ensure compatibility across different Android versions for handling touch events and gestures.This code snippet is from the `GestureDetectorCompat` class and handles touch events in the `onTouchEvent` method. The code updates the focus coordinates, computes velocity using a `VelocityTracker`, and checks for certain touch events such as double tapping, scrolling, and single tapping. It also dispatches touch events to the `OnGestureListener` and `OnDoubleTapListener` as appropriate.This code snippet is from the `GestureDetectorCompat` class and handles touch events in the `onTouchEvent` method.
