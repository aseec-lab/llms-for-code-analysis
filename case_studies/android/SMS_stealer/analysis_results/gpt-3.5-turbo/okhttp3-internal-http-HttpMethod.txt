The `HttpMethod.java` file in the OkHttp library defines several static methods for working with HTTP methods.

- `invalidatesCache(String paramString)`: Returns true if the given HTTP method invalidates the cache. This is true for methods like POST, PATCH, PUT, DELETE, and MOVE.

- `permitsRequestBody(String paramString)`: Returns true if the given HTTP method permits a request body. This is true for methods other than GET and HEAD.

- `redirectsToGet(String paramString)`: Returns true if the given HTTP method should be redirected to a GET request. This is true for all methods except PROPFIND.

- `redirectsWithBody(String paramString)`: Returns true if the given HTTP method should include a request body when redirected. This is true only for PROPFIND.

- `requiresRequestBody(String paramString)`: Returns true if the given HTTP method requires a request body. This is true for methods like POST, PUT, PATCH, PROPPATCH, and REPORT.
