The `GoalRow` class extends the `ArrayRow` class and represents a goal row in the solver. 

The `GoalRow` constructor accepts a `Cache` object as its parameter and calls the constructor of the `ArrayRow` class with the same parameter.

The `addError` method is overridden from the `ArrayRow` class. It adds an error to the goal row by calling the `addError` method of the superclass. It also decreases the `usageInRowCount` variable of the given `SolverVariable` object by one.
