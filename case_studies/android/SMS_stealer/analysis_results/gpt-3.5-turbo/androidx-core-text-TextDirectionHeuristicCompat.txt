This code defines an interface called "TextDirectionHeuristicCompat" in the package "androidx.core.text". This interface includes two methods: "isRtl" which takes a CharSequence, a start index, and an end index and returns a boolean value, and "isRtl" which takes a char array, a start index, and an end index and returns a boolean value. The purpose of these methods is to determine the text direction (right-to-left or left-to-right) based on the given parameters.
