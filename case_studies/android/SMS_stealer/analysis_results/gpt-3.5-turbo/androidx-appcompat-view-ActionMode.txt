The `ActionMode` class in the `androidx.appcompat.view` package provides an abstract representation of a contextual action mode, which is a floating toolbar that appears at the top of the screen and displays actions that are relevant to the selected content. It defines methods for managing the action mode, such as finishing it, getting the custom view, obtaining the menu, getting the menu inflater, retrieving the subtitle, setting the custom view, setting the subtitle, setting the tag, setting the title, and more. It also includes an inner `Callback` interface, which defines methods for handling action mode events such as clicking on an action item, creating the action mode, destroying the action mode, and preparing the action mode.
