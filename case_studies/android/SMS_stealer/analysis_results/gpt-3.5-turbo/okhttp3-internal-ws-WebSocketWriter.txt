The `WebSocketWriter` class is responsible for writing frames to a WebSocket connection. It maintains state information about the frame being written, such as the opcode and frame length.

The class provides methods to write control frames (PING, PONG, CLOSE) and message frames. It also handles the masking of payloads when writing frames to the connection.

The `WebSocketWriter` class has an inner class `FrameSink` that implements the `Sink` interface. This class handles the writing of message frames, including flushing the buffer and closing the frame.

Overall, the `WebSocketWriter` class is responsible for writing frames to a WebSocket connection and handling the masking of payloads.
