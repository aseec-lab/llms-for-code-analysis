The `ContentFrameLayout` class extends `FrameLayout` and provides additional functionality for managing the content frame of an activity.

The class has several fields that store typed values for fixed width and height, as well as minimum width values.

The class overrides the `onAttachedToWindow` and `onDetachedFromWindow` methods to handle attachment and detachment events.

The class overrides the `onMeasure` method to customize the measurement of the content frame. It adjusts the size based on fixed width and height values, as well as minimum width values.

The `ContentFrameLayout` class provides getters for the typed values, and a method to dispatch fit system windows.The `setAttachListener` method sets an `OnAttachListener` on the `ContentFrameLayout` instance.

The `setDecorPadding` method sets the padding of the decor area of the `ContentFrameLayout`.

The `OnAttachListener` interface defines two methods: `onAttachedFromWindow` and `onDetachedFromWindow`. These methods are called when the `ContentFrameLayout` is attached to or detached from the window.
