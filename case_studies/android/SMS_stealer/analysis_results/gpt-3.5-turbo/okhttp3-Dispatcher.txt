The `Dispatcher` class in the `okhttp3` package is responsible for managing and scheduling HTTP calls to ensure efficient and optimal usage of network resources.

Key Features:
- It manages a thread pool for executing asynchronous HTTP calls in parallel.
- It tracks the maximum number of requests that can be executed concurrently (`maxRequests`) and the maximum number of requests that can be executed concurrently for each host (`maxRequestsPerHost`).
- It maintains separate queues (`readyAsyncCalls`, `runningAsyncCalls`, and `runningSyncCalls`) to track the state of each HTTP call.
- It provides methods to enqueue new HTTP calls (`enqueue()`) and mark a call as executed and completed (`executed()` and `finished()`).
- It promotes calls from the `readyAsyncCalls` queue to the `runningAsyncCalls` queue if there are available resources to execute them.
- It provides a method to cancel all enqueued HTTP calls (`cancelAll()`).
- It provides a method to retrieve the executor service used for executing HTTP calls (`executorService()`).
- It provides a method to retrieve the current maximum number of requests that can be executed concurrently (`getMaxRequests()`).

Overall, the `Dispatcher` class in the OkHttp library is responsible for managing the execution and scheduling of HTTP calls to ensure efficient utilization of network resources and optimal performance.The `getMaxRequestsPerHost()` method returns the maximum number of requests that can be executed concurrently for each host.

The `queuedCalls()` method returns a list of `Call` objects that represents the HTTP calls that are currently in the queue and waiting to be executed.

The `queuedCallsCount()` method returns the number of HTTP calls that are currently in the queue and waiting to be executed.

The `runningCalls()` method returns a list of `Call` objects that represents the HTTP calls that are currently running.

The `runningCallsCount()` method returns the number of HTTP calls that are currently running.

The `setIdleCallback()` method sets a `Runnable` callback that will be called when there are no HTTP calls running or in the queue.

The `setMaxRequests()` method sets the maximum number of requests that can be executed concurrently.

The `setMaxRequestsPerHost()` method sets the maximum number of requests that can be executed concurrently for each host.
