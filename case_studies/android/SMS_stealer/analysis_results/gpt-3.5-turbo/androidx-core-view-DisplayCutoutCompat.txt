The `DisplayCutoutCompat` class in the `androidx.core.view` package provides compatibility methods for working with the `DisplayCutout` class.

The class represents a cutout area that has been cut out from the display. It provides methods for retrieving the bounding rectangles and safe insets of the cutout area.

The class has a constructor that takes a `Rect` object and a list of `Rect` objects to create a `DisplayCutoutCompat` instance.

The class has getter methods for retrieving the bounding rectangles and safe insets of the cutout area. These methods delegate the calls to the corresponding methods in the `DisplayCutout` class, providing a simpler interface for accessing the cutout properties.
