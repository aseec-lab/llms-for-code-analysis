The `MutableLiveData` class is a subclass of `LiveData` from the `androidx.lifecycle` package.

This class provides two methods: `postValue()` and `setValue()`. Both methods take a parameter of type `T` and call the corresponding methods in the superclass `LiveData` to set the value.

`postValue()` is used to set the value asynchronously, while `setValue()` is used to set the value synchronously.

This class is typically used to hold data that can be observed by other components in the Android lifecycle framework. It allows for the communication of data between different parts of an application in a lifecycle-aware way.
