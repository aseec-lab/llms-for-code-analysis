The code defines a class called ConfigurationCompat in the package androidx.core.os. 

The class provides one static method called getLocales. 

The getLocales method takes a Configuration object as a parameter and returns a LocaleListCompat object. 

The method checks if the Android version is at least 24 using the Build.VERSION.SDK_INT constant. If the version is at least 24, it wraps the locales from the given Configuration object using the LocaleListCompat.wrap method. Otherwise, it creates a new LocaleListCompat object with a single Locale object from the Configuration object. 

The class and method are marked as final, indicating that they cannot be extended or overridden. 

A comment at the end of the code includes the file path, Java compiler version, and JD-Core version.
