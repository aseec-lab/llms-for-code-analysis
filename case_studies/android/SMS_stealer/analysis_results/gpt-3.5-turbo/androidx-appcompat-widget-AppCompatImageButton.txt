The `AppCompatImageButton` class is a subclass of the `ImageButton` class and implements the `TintableBackgroundView` and `TintableImageSourceView` interfaces. It is part of the AppCompat library.

The class defines two private fields, `mBackgroundTintHelper` of type `AppCompatBackgroundHelper` and `mImageHelper` of type `AppCompatImageHelper`.

There are three constructors available. The first constructor initializes the image button with only the context. The second constructor initializes it with the context and attribute set. The third constructor initializes it with the context, attribute set, and style.

The `drawableStateChanged()` method is overridden to apply support background and image tint to the image button.

There are getter methods for retrieving the support background and image tint lists and modes.

The class also provides methods for setting the background drawable or resource, setting the image bitmap, drawable, or resource, setting the support background and image tint lists and modes, and checking if the image button has overlapping rendering.

Overall, the `AppCompatImageButton` class extends the functionality of the `ImageButton` class by providing support for background and image tinting. It uses the `AppCompatBackgroundHelper` and `AppCompatImageHelper` classes to apply the tinting.
