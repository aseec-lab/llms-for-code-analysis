The `Supplier` interface in the `androidx.core.util` package is a functional interface that defines a single method `get()`. 

The purpose of this interface is to provide a way to represent a supplier of values. The `get()` method can be implemented by any class that wants to act as a supplier and returns a value of type `T`.
