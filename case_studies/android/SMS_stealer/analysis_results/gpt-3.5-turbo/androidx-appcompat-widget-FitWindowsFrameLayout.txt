This code defines a custom class called `FitWindowsFrameLayout` which extends `FrameLayout` and implements the `FitWindowsViewGroup` interface. 

The `FitWindowsFrameLayout` class provides a way to listen for events when the system windows need to fit the content within the layout. 

It includes a constructor that takes a `Context` parameter and another constructor that takes a `Context` and `AttributeSet` parameter. 

The `fitSystemWindows` method is overridden to notify the listener when the system windows fit the layout, and then calls the super implementation. 

There is also a `setOnFitSystemWindowsListener` method to set the listener for the `FitWindowsViewGroup.OnFitSystemWindowsListener` interface.
