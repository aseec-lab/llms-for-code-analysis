The `LinkedTreeMap` class is an implementation of a ordered map using a linked tree data structure. It extends the `AbstractMap` class and implements the `Serializable` interface.

The class maintains a tree structure of nodes, where each node represents a key-value pair in the map. The nodes are connected through parent, left child, and right child references.

The class provides methods for basic map operations such as `put`, `get`, `remove`, and `containsKey`.

It also includes methods for rebalancing the tree after insertions and deletions, to ensure that the tree remains balanced and maintains the order of the keys.

The class also contains inner classes for the entry set and key set, which provide views of the map's entries and keys respectively.

Overall, the `LinkedTreeMap` class provides an efficient implementation of an ordered map using a linked tree data structure.The `LinkedTreeMap` class is an implementation of an ordered map using a linked tree data structure.

It stores key-value pairs and maintains references to parent, left child, and right child nodes. Some of its methods include `getKey` and `getValue` to retrieve the key and value stored in the node, `setValue` to update the value, `first` and `last` to get the first and last nodes in the tree, `hashCode` to compute the hash code of the node, and `toString` to retrieve a string representation of the node.
