The `LocationManagerCompat` class in the `androidx.core.location` package provides compatibility methods for working with location managers on different Android versions.

Key method and functionality:
- `isLocationEnabled(LocationManager paramLocationManager)`: Checks if location services are enabled. On Android API level 28 and above, it calls `isLocationEnabled()` directly. On lower versions, it checks if either the "network" or "gps" provider is enabled.

This class does not contain any state or constructors. It is final and cannot be extended.
