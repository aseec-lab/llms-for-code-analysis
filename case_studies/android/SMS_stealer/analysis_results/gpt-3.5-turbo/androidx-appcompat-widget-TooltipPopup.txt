The TooltipPopup class is responsible for displaying tooltip popups in an Android app. It creates a window with a TextView to display the tooltip message. The position of the tooltip is computed based on the anchor view and the screen dimensions. The tooltip is shown by adding the ContentView to the WindowManager, and hidden by removing it.

The TooltipPopup constructor initializes the necessary fields and sets up the window layout parameters.

The computePosition() method calculates the position of the tooltip based on the anchor view's position and dimensions. It takes into account the screen dimensions, whether the tooltip is being shown on a touch or non-touch device, and the offset values.

The getAppRootView() method returns the root view of the application, taking into account special cases such as fullscreen activities.

The hide() method removes the tooltip window from the WindowManager.

The isShowing() method checks if the tooltip window is currently being displayed.

The show() method sets the tooltip message, computes the position, and adds the ContentView to the WindowManager to show the tooltip.
