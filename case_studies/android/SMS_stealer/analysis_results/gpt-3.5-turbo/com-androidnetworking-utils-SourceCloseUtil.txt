The code in the "com/androidnetworking/utils/SourceCloseUtil.java" file is a utility class in the AndroidNetworking library that provides a method for closing the source of a response body.

Here is a brief description of what the code does:

- The class includes a static method called "close" that takes a Response object and an ANRequest object as parameters.
- Inside the "close" method, it first checks if the response type of the ANRequest is not equal to "OK_HTTP_RESPONSE" and if the response and its body are not null.
- If these conditions are met, it calls the "close" method on the source object of the response body to close it.
- There is a catch block that catches any exceptions that may occur during the closing of the source and does nothing with the caught exception.

In summary, this utility class in the AndroidNetworking library provides a method to close the source of a response body if certain conditions are met.
