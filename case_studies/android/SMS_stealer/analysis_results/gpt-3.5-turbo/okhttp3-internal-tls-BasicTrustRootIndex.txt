The code defines the `BasicTrustRootIndex` class within the `okhttp3.internal.tls` package.

- The class implements the `TrustRootIndex` interface, which represents a source of trust anchors.
- It maintains a linked hash map that maps `X500Principal` objects to sets of `X509Certificate` objects.
- The constructor takes an array of `X509Certificate` objects as parameter and populates the map with the certificates, grouping them by their subject principal.
- The class provides methods for equality comparison, finding a certificate by issuer and signature, and calculating the hash code based on the map's hash code.
