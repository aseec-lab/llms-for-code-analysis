The `FontsContractCompat` class in the `androidx.core.provider` package provides utility methods for working with fonts in a backward-compatible manner. It includes methods for fetching fonts from a provider, building typefaces, and converting signatures to byte arrays.This code snippet prepares font data by creating a map that associates a URI with its corresponding font data in the form of a ByteBuffer. The font data is extracted from an array of FontInfo objects. The method takes a Context, an array of FontInfo objects, and a CancellationSignal as input parameters.This code snippet is part of the `FontsContractCompat` class in the AndroidX Core library. It provides utility methods for working with fonts in Android applications.

The `prepareFontData()` method prepares font data by creating a map that associates a URI with its corresponding font data in the form of a `ByteBuffer`. The font data is extracted from an array of `FontInfo` objects. The method takes a `Context`, an array of `FontInfo` objects, and a `CancellationSignal` as input parameters.

The `requestFont()` method is a convenience method that calls the `requestFontInternal()` method with the appropriate parameters.

The `requestFontInternal()` method is a static method that requests a font from the system. It takes the application context, a `FontRequest`, a `FontRequestCallback`, and a `Handler` as input parameters. This method runs asynchronously on the specified `Handler` and performs the font request in a separate thread. It fetches the fonts using the `fetchFonts()` method, handles any errors, and retrieves the requested typeface if successful.

The `resetCache()` method clears the typeface cache used by the `FontsContractCompat` class.

The `Columns` class defines constants for the column names of the font provider database table.

The `FontFamilyResult` class is a data class that represents the result of fetching a font family. It contains an array of `FontInfo` objects and a status code.

The `FontInfo` class represents information about a font. It contains the URI of the font file, the TTC index, the font weight, whether it is italic, and a result code.

The `FontRequestCallback` class is a callback interface for receiving the result of a font request. It defines methods for handling success and failure scenarios.

The `TypefaceResult` class is a data class that represents the result of loading a typeface. It contains the loaded typeface and a result code.
