The code defines a class named `ViewPropertyAnimatorListenerAdapter` in the `androidx.core.view` package.

This class implements the `ViewPropertyAnimatorListener` interface, which provides callback methods for animations started via the `ViewPropertyAnimator` class.

The `ViewPropertyAnimatorListenerAdapter` class overrides the three callback methods of the `ViewPropertyAnimatorListener` interface: `onAnimationCancel()`, `onAnimationEnd()`, and `onAnimationStart()`. However, the implementation of these methods is empty, meaning that they do not perform any specific actions.

The purpose of this class is to provide a default implementation for `ViewPropertyAnimatorListener`, so that subclasses can selectively override only the methods they are interested in, without having to provide empty implementations for all callback methods.
