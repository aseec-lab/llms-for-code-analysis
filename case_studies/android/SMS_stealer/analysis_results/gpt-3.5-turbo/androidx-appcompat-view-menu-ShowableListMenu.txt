The `ShowableListMenu` interface in the `androidx.appcompat.view.menu` package defines methods for displaying and dismissing a list menu. It includes methods such as `dismiss()` to dismiss the menu, `getListView()` to retrieve the ListView associated with the menu, `isShowing()` to check if the menu is currently being shown, and `show()` to display the menu.
