The `RemoteInput` class in the `androidx.core.app` package provides methods for working with remote input, which allows users to input data from a notification without opening the app.

Some key features and methods of the `RemoteInput` class include:
- Constants for different edit choices before sending, such as enabled and disabled.
- Methods for adding data results and results to an `Intent`.
- Methods for getting and setting results source from an `Intent`.
- Methods for getting and setting extras from an `Intent`.
- Getter methods for various properties of the `RemoteInput`, such as label, choices, and allowed data types.

The `RemoteInput.Builder` class provides methods for building a `RemoteInput` object with the desired properties.The remaining code snippet defines the `Builder` class within the `RemoteInput` class, along with two `@Retention` annotations.

The `Builder` class is used to construct a `RemoteInput` object with the desired properties. It provides methods to set the allowed data types, allow free form input, set choices for the input, set edit choices before sending, and set the label for the input.

The `@Retention` annotations specify the retention policy for two custom annotations: `EditChoicesBeforeSending` and `Source`.
