The `PagerTitleStrip` class makes use of three `TextView` instances to display the titles and applies text appearance and styling to them. It also supports single-line and ellipsis text truncation.This code includes the implementation for the `PageListener` class and the `SingleLineAllCapsTransform` class within the `PagerTitleStrip` class.

It implements the `OnPageChangeListener` and `OnAdapterChangeListener` interfaces and overrides the corresponding methods to update the title strip's text and positions based on the current page.

The `SingleLineAllCapsTransform` class is a subclass of `SingleLineTransformationMethod` and is used to transform text to uppercase. It is used to display the titles in all capital letters.
