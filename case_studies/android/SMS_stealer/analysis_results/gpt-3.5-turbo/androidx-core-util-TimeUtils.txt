The `TimeUtils` class in the `androidx.core.util` package provides utility methods for formatting durations of time.

The class has several constants for representing seconds per day, hour, and minute.

It also has a `sFormatStr` array for storing formatted strings, and a `sFormatSync` object for synchronization.

The `formatDuration()` methods format a duration of time in milliseconds and print it to a `PrintWriter` or `StringBuilder` object.

The `accumField()` method calculates the number of digits required to represent a certain value, based on the given parameters.

The `formatDurationLocked()` method formats a duration of time in milliseconds and writes it to the `sFormatStr` array.

The `printField()` method formats a field of time (e.g., days, hours, minutes) and appends it to the `paramArrayOfchar` array.

Overall, the `TimeUtils` class provides methods for formatting durations of time in a human-readable format.
