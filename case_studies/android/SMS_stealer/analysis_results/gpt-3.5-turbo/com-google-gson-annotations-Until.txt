The code defines an annotation called `Until` in the `com.google.gson.annotations` package.

The annotation is used to specify the version number until which a field or class should be serialized/deserialized with Gson.

The `Until` annotation has one element:
- `value()`: Specifies the version number until which the field or class should be serialized/deserialized.

The annotation is documented and its retention policy is set to `RUNTIME`, which means it can be accessed at runtime using reflection.

The annotation can be applied to fields and classes using the `@Target` annotation.
