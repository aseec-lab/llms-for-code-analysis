The code is a class named `MainActivity2` in the package `ir.siqe.holo`.

The `MainActivity2` class extends `AppCompatActivity` and represents the second activity of the application. It overrides the `onCreate()` method to set the layout file and initialize a `WebView`.

Inside the `onCreate()` method, the `WebView` is configured with settings such as enabling JavaScript, enabling DOM storage, and adjusting the view port. It also sets a `WebViewClient` on the `WebView`.

The `WebViewClient` class is a nested class within `MainActivity2` and extends `WebViewClient`. It overrides several methods related to web page loading and error handling. For example, the `onPageStarted()` and `onPageFinished()` methods are called when a web page starts and finishes loading, respectively. The `onReceivedError()` method is called when an error occurs during page loading.

The `shouldOverrideUrlLoading()` method is overridden to load URLs in the `WebView` itself instead of launching external browsers.

Overall, the `MainActivity2` class defines the behavior of the second activity, including handling web page loading events and errors, and configuring the `WebView`.
