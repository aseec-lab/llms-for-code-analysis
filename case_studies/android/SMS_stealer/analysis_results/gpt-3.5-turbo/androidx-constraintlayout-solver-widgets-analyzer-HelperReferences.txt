The `HelperReferences` class extends the `WidgetRun` class. It represents a helper widget that acts as a reference for barriers in ConstraintLayout. The `apply` method sets up the dependencies between the barrier and the widgets it depends on. The `applyToWidget` method applies the computed values to the barrier widget's position. The `update` method updates the position of the barrier based on its dependencies.
