The `KeyPositionBase` class is an abstract class that extends the `Key` class and represents a base class for keyframes related to position in a MotionLayout animation. 

It defines a constant `SELECTION_SLOPE` with a value of 20.0F and an `mCurveFit` variable that is used to specify the curve fit type for the keyframe. 

The class declares several abstract methods: 
- `calcPosition()` is responsible for calculating the position of the keyframe based on the specified parameters.
- `getAttributeNames()` is used to get the attribute names associated with the keyframe.
- `getPositionX()` and `getPositionY()` return the X and Y position of the keyframe, respectively.
- `intersects()` checks if the keyframe intersects with the specified parameters.
- `positionAttributes()` applies the position attributes to the specified view.

In addition, the class provides a default implementation for the `getAttributeNames()` method, which does nothing.
