The `RemoteActionCompatParcelizer.java` file in the `androidx.core.app` package provides methods for reading and writing `RemoteActionCompat` objects to and from a `VersionedParcel`.

The `read()` method reads the values of `RemoteActionCompat` properties from the `VersionedParcel` and returns a new instance of `RemoteActionCompat` with the populated properties.

The `write()` method writes the values of `RemoteActionCompat` properties to the `VersionedParcel`.

The `RemoteActionCompatParcelizer` class serves as a helper class for serializing and deserializing `RemoteActionCompat` objects.
