The `Header` class in the `okhttp3.internal.http2` package defines HTTP/2 headers. It provides constants for commonly used header names, such as `PSEUDO_PREFIX`, `RESPONSE_STATUS`, `TARGET_AUTHORITY`, `TARGET_METHOD`, `TARGET_PATH`, and `TARGET_SCHEME`. 

Each `Header` object represents a single header and has a name and value, both of type `ByteString`. The class also includes an `hpackSize` field, which represents the size of the header when encoded in HPACK format. 

The class provides constructors to create `Header` objects with different combinations of strings and `ByteString` values. It also overrides the `equals()`, `hashCode()`, and `toString()` methods for comparison and debugging purposes.
