The `WebSocket` interface is a part of the OkHttp library. It provides methods to interact with a WebSocket connection.

The methods in this interface include:
- `cancel()`: Cancels the WebSocket connection.
- `close(int code, @Nullable String reason)`: Closes the WebSocket connection with the given code and reason.
- `queueSize()`: Returns the number of messages in the send queue.
- `request()`: Returns the original request that initiated the WebSocket connection.
- `send(String text)`: Sends a text message over the WebSocket connection.
- `send(ByteString bytes)`: Sends a binary message over the WebSocket connection.

Additionally, there is a nested interface `Factory` that defines a method for creating a new `WebSocket` instance.

The code is part of the OkHttp library and is used to manage WebSocket communication.
