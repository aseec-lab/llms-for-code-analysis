The `ComponentActivity` class extends the `Activity` class and implements the `LifecycleOwner` and `KeyEventDispatcher.Component` interfaces. It contains methods for handling key events, managing lifecycle, and storing extra data.

Key methods and functionalities:
- `dispatchKeyEvent()` and `dispatchKeyShortcutEvent()`: Handles key events by dispatching them to the appropriate views and components.
- `getExtraData()` and `putExtraData()`: Allows storing and retrieving extra data associated with the activity.
- `getLifecycle()`: Returns the `Lifecycle` object associated with the activity.
- `onCreate()` and `onSaveInstanceState()`: Overrides the lifecycle methods of `Activity` to inject a `ReportFragment` and mark the state of the lifecycle.
- `ExtraData` class: A deprecated static nested class for storing additional data associated with the activity.
