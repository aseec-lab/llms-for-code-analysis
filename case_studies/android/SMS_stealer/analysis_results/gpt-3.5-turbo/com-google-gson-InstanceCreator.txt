The `InstanceCreator` interface defines a method `createInstance` that is used to create instances of a specific type `T`. The method takes a `Type` parameter and returns an object of type `T`. This interface is typically used in conjunction with Gson to create instances of types that do not have a default constructor or have complex instantiation logic.
