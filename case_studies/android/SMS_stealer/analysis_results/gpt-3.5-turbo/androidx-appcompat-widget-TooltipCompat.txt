The `TooltipCompat` class in the `androidx.appcompat.widget` package provides a compatibility wrapper for setting tooltip text on a `View` object.

The class contains a single static method `setTooltipText()` which takes a `View` and a `CharSequence` as parameters. It checks the API level of the device and calls the appropriate method to set the tooltip text. 

If the device has an API level of 26 or higher, it calls the `setTooltipText()` method directly on the `View` object. Otherwise, it delegates the task to the `TooltipCompatHandler` class, which provides compatibility support for setting tooltip text on older devices.

The purpose of this class is to ensure that tooltip functionality is consistent across different API levels.
