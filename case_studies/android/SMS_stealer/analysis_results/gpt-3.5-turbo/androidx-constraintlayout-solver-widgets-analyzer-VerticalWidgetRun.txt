The `VerticalWidgetRun` class is a subclass of `WidgetRun` and is responsible for calculating the vertical positioning and dimensions of a `ConstraintWidget` within a ConstraintLayout. It contains methods for applying the calculated values to the widget and updating the run based on dependencies. It also handles different types of vertical dimension behaviors such as `MATCH_CONSTRAINT` and `MATCH_PARENT`.The remaining code calculates the positions of the widget vertically within the ConstraintLayout. It determines the start and end positions based on the available space, dimension, and constraints.

1. The code checks if the widget has a vertical dimension behavior of `MATCH_CONSTRAINT`. If it does, it calculates the available space by subtracting the vertical bias and the margin of the widget from the total available space. It then calculates the start position based on the available space and the vertical bias.

2. If the widget does not have a `MATCH_CONSTRAINT` behavior, the code checks if it has a vertical dimension behavior of `MATCH_PARENT`. If it does, the start position is set to the top of the ConstraintLayout and the end position is set to the bottom of the ConstraintLayout.

3. If the widget does not have a `MATCH_PARENT` behavior, the code calculates the start position by adding the vertical bias and the widget's top margin to the total available space.

4. The code then resolves the positions by rounding the calculated values and applying them to the widget's start and end positions.

5. Finally, the code updates the resolved values of the start and end positions based on the calculated dimension.
