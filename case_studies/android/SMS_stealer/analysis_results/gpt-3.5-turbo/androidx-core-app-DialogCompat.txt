The code in the file `DialogCompat.java` is part of the `androidx.core.app` package and contains a class called `DialogCompat`. This class provides a static method called `requireViewById` that helps retrieve a `View` from a `Dialog` by its resource ID.

Here is a summary of what the code does:

- The `DialogCompat` class provides a static method called `requireViewById` that takes a `Dialog` object and a resource ID as parameters.
- If the device's SDK version is 28 or higher, the method calls the `requireViewById` method directly on the `Dialog` object and returns the result.
- If the SDK version is below 28, the method calls the `findViewById` method on the `Dialog` object to retrieve the `View` with the specified resource ID.
- If the `View` is not found (i.e., `view` is `null`), the method throws an `IllegalArgumentException` with the message "ID does not reference a View inside this Dialog".

This code ensures compatibility across different SDK versions when retrieving a `View` from a `Dialog`.
