The `VectorDrawableCommon` class in the `androidx.vectordrawable.graphics.drawable` package is an abstract class that extends the `Drawable` class and implements the `TintAwareDrawable` interface. It provides common methods for vector drawables that are used by different vector drawable implementations.

- The class has a `mDelegateDrawable` field of type `Drawable` which represents the actual drawable object to which the common methods are delegated.
- The `applyTheme()` method applies a theme to the delegate drawable if it exists.
- The `clearColorFilter()` method clears the color filter of the delegate drawable if it exists, otherwise it calls the superclass method.
- The `getCurrent()` method returns the current drawable of the delegate drawable if it exists, otherwise it calls the superclass method.
- The `getMinimumHeight()` method returns the minimum height of the delegate drawable if it exists, otherwise it calls the superclass method.
- The `getMinimumWidth()` method returns the minimum width of the delegate drawable if it exists, otherwise it calls the superclass method.
- The `getPadding()` method returns the padding of the delegate drawable if it exists, otherwise it calls the superclass method.
- The `getState()` method returns the state of the delegate drawable if it exists, otherwise it calls the superclass method.
- The `getTransparentRegion()` method returns the transparent region of the delegate drawable if it exists, otherwise it calls the superclass method.
- The `jumpToCurrentState()` method causes the delegate drawable to jump to its current state if it exists.
- The `onBoundsChange()` method sets the bounds of the delegate drawable if it exists, otherwise it calls the superclass method.
- The `onLevelChange()` method changes the level of the delegate drawable if it exists, otherwise it calls the superclass method.
- The `setChangingConfigurations()` method sets the changing configurations of the delegate drawable if it exists, otherwise it calls the superclass method.
- The `setColorFilter()` method sets the color filter of the delegate drawable if it exists, otherwise it calls the superclass method.
- The `setFilterBitmap()` method sets the filter bitmap flag of the delegate drawable if it exists.
- The `setHotspot()` method sets the hotspot coordinates of the delegate drawable if it exists.
- The `setHotspotBounds()` method sets the hotspot bounds of the delegate drawable if it exists.
- The `setState()` method sets the state of the delegate drawable if it exists, otherwise it calls the superclass method.
