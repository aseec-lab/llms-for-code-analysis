The `KeyAttributes` class extends the abstract `Key` class in the `androidx.constraintlayout.motion.widget` package. Here's a summary of what the code does:

- It defines constants for the key type and the name of the class.
- It declares private variables for various attributes such as alpha, rotation, scale, etc.
- It provides methods to add values to a hashmap based on the attribute name, to get attribute names, to get the curve fit, to load attributes from XML, and to set interpolation values in a hashmap.
- It overrides the `addValues` method to set the points for the spline sets based on the frame position.
- It overrides the `getAttributeNames` method to add attribute names to a hashset.
- It provides a method to get the curve fit value.
- It overrides the `load` method to read attributes from XML using the `Loader.read` method.
- It overrides the `setInterpolation` method to set interpolation values in the provided hashmap based on the curve fit value.
- It provides a method to set the value of an attribute based on the attribute name.The remaining part of the previous code includes:

- A private static nested class called `Loader`, which is used to load attribute values from a `TypedArray` into a `KeyAttributes` object. It contains a map of attribute IDs and constants for each attribute.
- The `read` method in the `Loader` class reads the attribute values from the `TypedArray` based on their index and sets the corresponding values in the `KeyAttributes` object.
- The attribute values are retrieved using the `get` methods of the `TypedArray`, and appropriate setter methods of the `KeyAttributes` object are called to set the attribute values.
- The `switch` statement in the `read` method handles each attribute based on its ID, and sets the corresponding value in the `KeyAttributes` object using the appropriate setter method.
- The `mAttrMap` in the `Loader` class is a `SparseIntArray` that maps attribute IDs to their corresponding constants.
- The `mAttrMap` is initialized with mappings from resource styleable attributes to their corresponding constants using the `append` method of the `SparseIntArray`.
