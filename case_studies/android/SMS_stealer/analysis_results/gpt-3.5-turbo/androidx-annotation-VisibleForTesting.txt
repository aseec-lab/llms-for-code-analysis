The code defines the `VisibleForTesting` annotation in the `androidx.annotation` package. This annotation is used to annotate methods, fields, and classes that are visible for testing purposes.

The `VisibleForTesting` annotation has a retention policy of `RetentionPolicy.CLASS`, meaning it is stored in the compiled bytecode but not available at runtime.

The `VisibleForTesting` annotation has four static final integer variables: `NONE`, `PACKAGE_PRIVATE`, `PRIVATE`, and `PROTECTED`. These variables can be used to specify the level of visibility for testing.

The `VisibleForTesting` annotation has an `otherwise()` method that defaults to `2`, which represents `PRIVATE` visibility. This method can be used to specify the default visibility if no specific visibility level is provided.

The code does not contain any functional logic. It only defines the `VisibleForTesting` annotation and its associated constants.
