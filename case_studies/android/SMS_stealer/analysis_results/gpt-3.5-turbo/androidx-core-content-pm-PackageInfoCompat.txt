The code defines a class named `PackageInfoCompat` in the `androidx.core.content.pm` package.

Inside the class, there is a single static method `getLongVersionCode()` that returns the long version code of a given `PackageInfo` object. The method checks the SDK version of the device and retrieves the version code using different methods based on the SDK version. If the SDK version is 28 or above, it calls `paramPackageInfo.getLongVersionCode()`, otherwise, it returns `paramPackageInfo.versionCode`.
