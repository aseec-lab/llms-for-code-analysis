The code defines an abstract class named FragmentContainer.

The class contains a deprecated method named `instantiate()` which takes a Context, a String, and a Bundle as arguments and returns a Fragment. The method calls the `instantiate()` method of the Fragment class.

The class also declares two abstract methods: `onFindViewById()` and `onHasView()`. These methods are meant to be implemented by subclasses and are used for finding views by their ID and checking if the container has a view, respectively.
