The code defines a `MultipartStringBody` class in the `com.androidnetworking.model` package.

The `MultipartStringBody` class has two public fields: `contentType` and `value`. These fields represent the content type and value of a multipart string body.

The class has a constructor that takes two parameters: `paramString1` and `paramString2`. These parameters are used to initialize the `value` and `contentType` fields, respectively.
