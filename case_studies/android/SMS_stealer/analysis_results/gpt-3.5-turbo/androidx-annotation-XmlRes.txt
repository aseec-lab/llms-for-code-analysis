The code defines the `XmlRes` annotation in the `androidx.annotation` package. This annotation is used to indicate that a method parameter, field, or local variable should be a valid XML resource identifier.

The `XmlRes` annotation can be applied to methods, parameters, fields, and local variables using the `@Target` annotation.

The `XmlRes` annotation is documented, meaning its description and usage documentation can be accessed at runtime.

The `XmlRes` annotation has a retention policy of `RetentionPolicy.CLASS`, meaning it is stored in the compiled bytecode but not available at runtime.

The code does not contain any functional logic. It only defines the `XmlRes` annotation and its associated target elements.
