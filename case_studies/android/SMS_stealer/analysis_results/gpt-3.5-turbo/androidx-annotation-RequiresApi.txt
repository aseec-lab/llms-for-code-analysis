The code defines the `RequiresApi` annotation in the `androidx.annotation` package. This annotation is used to indicate that a method, class, field, constructor, or package requires a specific API level to be used.

The `RequiresApi` annotation can be applied to classes, methods, constructors, fields, and packages, as specified by the `@Target` annotation.

The `RequiresApi` annotation has a retention policy of `RetentionPolicy.CLASS`, meaning it is stored in the compiled bytecode but not available at runtime.

The `RequiresApi` annotation has two attributes, `api` and `value`, both of which have a default value of 1. This means that the annotated element requires API level 1 by default.
