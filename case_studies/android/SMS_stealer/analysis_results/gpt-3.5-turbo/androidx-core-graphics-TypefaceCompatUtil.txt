The `TypefaceCompatUtil` class in the `androidx.core.graphics` package provides utility methods for working with TypefaceCompat.

Here's a summary of what each method does:

1. `closeQuietly()`: Closes a Closeable resource without throwing an exception.
2. `copyToDirectBuffer()`: Copies the contents of a resource file to a temporary file and returns it as a DirectByteBuffer.
3. `copyToFile()`: Copies the contents of a resource file to a specified file.
4. `getTempFile()`: Returns a temporary file in the cache directory.
5. `mmap()`: Maps a file to a read-only DirectByteBuffer.
6. `mmap(Context, CancellationSignal, Uri)`: Opens a file descriptor for a specified URI, then maps it to a read-only DirectByteBuffer.

This class also includes a constant for the cache file prefix and a constant for the log tag.
