The code defines the `ContentView` annotation in the `androidx.annotation` package. This annotation can only be applied to constructors.

The `ContentView` annotation is used to indicate that the annotated constructor sets the content view for an activity or a dialog.

The `ContentView` annotation has a retention policy of `RetentionPolicy.CLASS`, meaning it is stored in the compiled bytecode but not available at runtime.

This annotation is documented and can be used as a marker for constructors that set the content view in the target project.
