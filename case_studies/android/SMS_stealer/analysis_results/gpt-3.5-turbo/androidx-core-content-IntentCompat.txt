The `IntentCompat` class in the `androidx.core.content` package provides compatibility methods for working with intents.

The class defines three public static final string constants: `CATEGORY_LEANBACK_LAUNCHER`, `EXTRA_HTML_TEXT`, and `EXTRA_START_PLAYBACK`. These constants represent specific category and extra keys that can be used when creating or working with intents.

The class also provides a `makeMainSelectorActivity()` method that creates an intent to launch an activity that matches a specific action and category. On devices with SDK version 15 (Android 4.0.3) and above, it delegates to `Intent.makeMainSelectorActivity()` method. On lower version devices, it manually creates an intent and adds the given action and category to it. The created intent is then returned.

This class helps provide compatibility for creating main selector activities across different Android versions.
