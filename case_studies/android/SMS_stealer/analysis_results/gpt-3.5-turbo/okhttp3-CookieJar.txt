The code represents the `CookieJar` interface in the `okhttp3` package. 

- The `CookieJar` interface is used to manage cookies for HTTP requests and responses.
- It declares two methods: `loadForRequest` and `saveFromResponse`, which are used to load cookies for a given request and save cookies from a response, respectively.
- The `CookieJar.NO_COOKIES` is a constant that represents a default implementation of `CookieJar` which doesn't handle any cookies.
