The `RequestType` interface defines three static final variables: `DOWNLOAD`, `MULTIPART`, and `SIMPLE`. These variables represent different types of network requests that can be made using the AndroidNetworking library.

- `DOWNLOAD` represents a request for downloading a file.
- `MULTIPART` represents a request for sending multipart data, such as uploading files or sending form data.
- `SIMPLE` represents a simple request for performing a basic HTTP operation.

The interface does not have any methods or implementation details. It only serves as a reference for the available request types in the AndroidNetworking library.
