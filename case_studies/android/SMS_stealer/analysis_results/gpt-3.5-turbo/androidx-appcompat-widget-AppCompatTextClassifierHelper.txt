The `AppCompatTextClassifierHelper` class is part of the AndroidX AppCompat library. It is responsible for providing a text classifier for a `TextView` in the context of AppCompat.

The class has the following members:
- `mTextClassifier` is an instance of `TextClassifier` used for text classification.
- `mTextView` is a reference to the `TextView` for which the text classifier is being provided.

The class provides methods for getting and setting the text classifier. The `getTextClassifier()` method returns the current text classifier, either from the `TextClassificationManager` or a no-op text classifier if the manager is not available. The `setTextClassifier()` method is used to set a custom text classifier for the `TextView`.

The class is used internally by the AppCompat library to provide text classification functionality to `TextViews` in the context of AppCompat.
