The `WorkerThread` annotation is defined in the `androidx.annotation` package.

This annotation is used to annotate methods, constructors, types, and parameters that are expected to be executed on a worker thread.

It is a `@Retention` annotation with a policy of `CLASS`, which means it will be retained during compile time and available for inspection via reflection at runtime.

This annotation is also `@Documented`, which means it will be included in the generated API documentation.

The `@Target` annotation specifies that this annotation can be applied to methods, constructors, types, and parameters.

The purpose of this annotation is to provide clear documentation and enforce proper usage of worker threads in the codebase.
