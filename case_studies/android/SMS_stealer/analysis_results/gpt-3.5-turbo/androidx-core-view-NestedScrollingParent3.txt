The code defines the interface `NestedScrollingParent3` in the `androidx.core.view` package.

This interface extends the `NestedScrollingParent2` interface.

It declares a single method `onNestedScroll()` that is called when a nested scrolling child view dispatches a nested scroll event to the parent view. The method takes several parameters including the child view, scroll distance values, and an array to hold the consumed scroll values.

The purpose of this interface is to provide additional functionality and callbacks for parent views that implement nested scrolling behavior.
