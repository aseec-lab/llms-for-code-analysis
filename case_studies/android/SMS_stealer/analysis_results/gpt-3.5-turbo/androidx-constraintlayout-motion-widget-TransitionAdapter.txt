The `TransitionAdapter` class is an abstract class within the `androidx.constraintlayout.motion.widget` package. It extends the `MotionLayout.TransitionListener` interface.

This class provides default implementations for the methods defined in the `MotionLayout.TransitionListener` interface. These methods are:

- `onTransitionChange()`: This method is called when the motion layout's state changes during the transition. It receives the motion layout, the start and end state, and the progress of the transition.

- `onTransitionCompleted()`: This method is called when the motion layout's transition is completed. It receives the motion layout and the current state.

- `onTransitionStarted()`: This method is called when the motion layout's transition starts. It receives the motion layout and the start and end state.

- `onTransitionTrigger()`: This method is called when a trigger is triggered during the transition. It receives the motion layout, the trigger ID, a boolean indicating whether the trigger fired, and the progress of the transition.
