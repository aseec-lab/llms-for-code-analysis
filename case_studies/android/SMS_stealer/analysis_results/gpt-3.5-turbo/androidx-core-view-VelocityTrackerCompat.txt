The `VelocityTrackerCompat` class in the `androidx.core.view` package provides compatibility methods for working with the `VelocityTracker` class.

The class is marked as deprecated, which means it is no longer recommended to use this class in new code.

The class provides two static methods: `getXVelocity` and `getYVelocity`. These methods take a `VelocityTracker` object and an index parameter, and return the velocity of the pointer specified by the index in the X and Y directions, respectively.

These methods simply delegate the calls to the corresponding methods in the `VelocityTracker` class, providing a simpler interface for accessing velocity values.
