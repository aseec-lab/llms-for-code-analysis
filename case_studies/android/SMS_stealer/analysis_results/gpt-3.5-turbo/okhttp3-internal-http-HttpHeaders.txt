The "HttpHeaders.java" file in the OkHttp library contains utility methods for working with HTTP headers.

The class provides methods to check if a response has a body, parse challenges from headers, parse a string into seconds, receive headers and save cookies from a response, and skip whitespace and characters until a specified delimiter.

It also includes methods to convert a content length header value to a long, extract vary fields from headers, and create headers that match specified vary fields.

The class uses regular expressions, string manipulation, and basic type conversion to perform these operations.
