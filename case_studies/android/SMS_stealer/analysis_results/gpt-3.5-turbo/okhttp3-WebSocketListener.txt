The `WebSocketListener` class is part of the OkHttp library and is used for handling WebSocket events. Here is a summary of the code:

- The class is an abstract class and defines several methods for handling different WebSocket events.
- The `onClosed` method is called when the WebSocket connection is closed. It takes the WebSocket instance, an integer status code, and a closing reason as parameters.
- The `onClosing` method is called when the WebSocket connection is about to be closed. It takes the WebSocket instance, an integer status code, and a closing reason as parameters.
- The `onFailure` method is called when there is a failure in the WebSocket connection. It takes the WebSocket instance, a Throwable representing the failure, and an optional Response object as parameters.
- The `onMessage` method is called when a text message is received over the WebSocket connection. It takes the WebSocket instance and the received message as parameters.
- The `onMessage` method is also overloaded to handle binary messages received over the WebSocket connection. It takes the WebSocket instance and a ByteString representing the received message as parameters.
- The `onOpen` method is called when the WebSocket connection is successfully established. It takes the WebSocket instance and a Response object representing the server's response as parameters.
