The code defines a class called EnvironmentCompat in the package androidx.core.os.

The class provides a method called getStorageState that returns the storage state of a given file.

The method first checks the Android SDK version and uses the appropriate method to obtain the storage state.

If the SDK version is 21 or higher, it calls Environment.getExternalStorageState(paramFile).

If the SDK version is between 19 and 21, it calls Environment.getStorageState(paramFile).

If the SDK version is lower than 19, it tries to compare the canonical path of the file with the canonical path of the external storage directory using Environment.getExternalStorageDirectory().getCanonicalPath(). If they match, it calls Environment.getExternalStorageState().

If any exceptions occur during the canonical path resolution, it logs a warning message with the exception details.

The class also declares a constant String "MEDIA_UNKNOWN" and a private constant String "TAG".

A comment at the end of the code includes the file path, Java compiler version, and JD-Core version.
