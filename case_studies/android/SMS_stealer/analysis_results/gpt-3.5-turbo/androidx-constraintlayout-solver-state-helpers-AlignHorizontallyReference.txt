The `AlignHorizontallyReference` class is a subclass of the `HelperReference` class in the `androidx.constraintlayout.solver.state.helpers` package. It is responsible for handling horizontal alignment in ConstraintLayout.

Here's a summary of what the code does:

- The class has private fields to store the horizontal alignment references for start to start, start to end, end to start, and end to end.
- The constructor takes a State object as a parameter and assigns it to the superclass field.
- The `apply` method is used to apply the horizontal alignment constraints to the referenced constraint references.
- The `bias` method is used to set the horizontal bias of the alignment.
- The `startToStart`, `startToEnd`, `endToStart`, and `endToEnd` methods are used to set the horizontal alignment references.
