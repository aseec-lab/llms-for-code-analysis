The `FitWindowsLinearLayout` class is a subclass of the `LinearLayout` class and implements the `FitWindowsViewGroup` interface. It is part of the AppCompat library.

The class defines a private field `mListener` of type `FitWindowsViewGroup.OnFitSystemWindowsListener`.

There are two constructors available. The first constructor initializes the linear layout with only the context. The second constructor initializes it with the context and attribute set.

The `fitSystemWindows()` method is overridden to call the `onFitSystemWindows()` method of the listener, if it is not null, and then return the result of the super class's `fitSystemWindows()` method.

The `setOnFitSystemWindowsListener()` method sets the listener for handling system window fitting.

Overall, the `FitWindowsLinearLayout` class allows a listener to be set for handling system window fitting in a linear layout.
