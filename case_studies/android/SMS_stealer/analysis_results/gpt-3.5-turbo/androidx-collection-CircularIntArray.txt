The `CircularIntArray` class provides a dynamic circular array implementation in Java. It allows adding and removing elements from both ends of the array, and provides methods to access the elements at specific positions. The array capacity is dynamically adjusted as needed.

The class has the following main methods:
- `addFirst(int paramInt)`: Adds an element to the beginning of the array.
- `addLast(int paramInt)`: Adds an element to the end of the array.
- `clear()`: Removes all elements from the array.
- `get(int paramInt)`: Retrieves the element at the specified position in the array.
- `getFirst()`: Retrieves the first element in the array.
- `getLast()`: Retrieves the last element in the array.
- `isEmpty()`: Checks if the array is empty.
- `popFirst()`: Removes and returns the first element in the array.
- `popLast()`: Removes and returns the last element in the array.
- `removeFromEnd(int paramInt)`: Removes the specified number of elements from the end of the array.
- `removeFromStart(int paramInt)`: Removes the specified number of elements from the start of the array.
- `size()`: Returns the number of elements in the array.

The class uses a circular array with an underlying dynamic array implementation. The capacity of the array is adjusted to the nearest power of 2 to optimize performance. The array indices are calculated using the bitwise AND operation with the capacity bitmask.

Overall, the `CircularIntArray` class provides a flexible and efficient implementation of a circular array data structure.
