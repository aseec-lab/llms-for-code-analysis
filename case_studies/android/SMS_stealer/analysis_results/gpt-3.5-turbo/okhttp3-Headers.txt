The `Headers` class in the `okhttp3` package represents HTTP headers. It provides methods to create and manipulate headers.

The class stores header names and values as an array of strings. It allows headers to be created from a map of name-value pairs or from individual name-value pairs.

The class provides methods to retrieve specific headers, get the number of headers, get the total byte count of the headers, and convert the headers to a string.

The `Builder` class is a nested class within `Headers` that provides a convenient way to build headers. It allows headers to be added or removed. The `Builder` class also performs validation on the header names and values.The code snippet you provided is the remaining part of the `Headers` class in the `okhttp3` package.
