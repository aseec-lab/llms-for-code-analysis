The code defines the `FloatRange` annotation in the `androidx.annotation` package. This annotation is used to annotate parameters, methods, local variables, fields, and annotation types that represent floating-point values within a specific range.

The `FloatRange` annotation has several attributes:
- `from`: Specifies the lower bound of the range. The default value is `-Infinity`.
- `fromInclusive`: Specifies whether the lower bound is inclusive (`true`) or exclusive (`false`). The default value is `true`.
- `to`: Specifies the upper bound of the range. The default value is `Infinity`.
- `toInclusive: Specifies whether the upper bound is inclusive (`true`) or exclusive (`false`). The default value is `true`.

The `FloatRange` annotation has a retention policy of `RetentionPolicy.CLASS`, meaning it is retained in the compiled bytecode.
