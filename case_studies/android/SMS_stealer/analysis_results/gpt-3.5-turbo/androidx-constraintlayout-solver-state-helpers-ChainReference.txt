The `ChainReference` class extends the `HelperReference` class and is used to handle chains in ConstraintLayout.

Here's a summary of what the code does:

- The class has private fields to store the chain bias value and chain style.
- The constructor takes a State object and a Helper object as parameters and assigns them to fields.
- The `bias` method is used to set the chain bias value.
- The `getBias` method returns the chain bias value.
- The `getStyle` method returns the chain style.
- The `style` method is used to set the chain style.
