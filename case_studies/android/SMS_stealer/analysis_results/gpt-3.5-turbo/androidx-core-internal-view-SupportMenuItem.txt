The `SupportMenuItem` interface is part of the `androidx.core.internal.view` package and extends the `MenuItem` interface. It defines several constants and methods for manipulating menu items in a backward-compatible way.

The interface includes methods for collapsing and expanding the action view, getting and setting the action view, retrieving the modifiers for alphabetic and numeric shortcuts, obtaining the content description and tooltip text, checking if the action view is expanded, determining if an action button is required, and if the item requires overflow.

It also contains methods for setting the action view, setting shortcuts, setting the alphabetic shortcut, setting the content description, setting the icon tint list and mode, setting the numeric shortcut, setting the show as action flags, and setting the support action provider.

Overall, the `SupportMenuItem` interface provides a way to work with menu items in a backward-compatible manner by extending the functionality of the `MenuItem` interface.
