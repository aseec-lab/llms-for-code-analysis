The `AppCompatImageView` class is a subclass of `ImageView` in the Android AppCompat library. It implements the `TintableBackgroundView` and `TintableImageSourceView` interfaces.

The class has the following members:
- `mBackgroundTintHelper` is an instance of the `AppCompatBackgroundHelper` class, used for handling background tinting.
