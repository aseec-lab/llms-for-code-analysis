The `NotificationCompatBuilder.java` file in the `androidx.core.app` package provides a class called `NotificationCompatBuilder`. This class is responsible for building `Notification` objects in a backward-compatible way.

The `NotificationCompatBuilder` class implements the `NotificationBuilderWithBuilderAccessor` interface. It contains several private fields, such as a list of action extras, remote views for different layouts, a `Notification.Builder` object, and a bundle of extras.

The constructor of `NotificationCompatBuilder` initializes the fields and sets the necessary properties of the `Notification.Builder` object based on the properties of the `NotificationCompat.Builder` passed in.

The `addAction()` method adds an action to the notification. It creates a `Notification.Action.Builder` object and sets the properties of the action based on the properties of the `NotificationCompat.Action` passed in. The action is then added to the `Notification.Builder` object.

The `removeSoundAndVibration()` method removes sound and vibration settings from the notification.

The `build()` method builds and returns the final `Notification` object. It applies the style, sets the content views, and adds any additional extras to the notification.

The `buildInternal()` method is called by `build()` and is responsible for building the notification object based on the API level. It sets the necessary properties and handles compatibility for different Android versions.

Overall, the `NotificationCompatBuilder` class provides a way to build notifications with backward compatibility by using the `Notification.Builder` class and handling differences between Android versions.The remaining code in the `NotificationCompatBuilder` class contains the implementation of the `build()` method, which builds and returns the final `Notification` object based on the API level.

For API levels 19 and higher, it creates a `SparseArray` of action extras and adds it to the notification's extras. Then, it sets the content views of the notification and returns the built notification.

For API level 16, it builds the notification and retrieves its extras. It creates a new bundle based on the extras and removes any duplicate keys. It then adds this new bundle to the notification's extras. It also creates a `SparseArray` of action extras and adds it to the notification's extras. Finally, it sets the content views of the notification and returns the built notification.

For API levels below 16, it simply returns the notification directly from the underlying `Notification.Builder` object.

The `getBuilder()` method returns the underlying `Notification.Builder` object used by the `NotificationCompatBuilder`.
