The `Primitives` class in the `com.google.gson.internal` package provides utility methods for working with primitive types in Java.

It maintains two maps: `PRIMITIVE_TO_WRAPPER_TYPE`, which maps primitive types to their respective wrapper types, and `WRAPPER_TO_PRIMITIVE_TYPE`, which maps wrapper types to their respective primitive types.

The class includes static initialization blocks that populate the maps with the mappings for boolean, byte, char, double, float, int, long, short, and void types.

The class has methods such as `isPrimitive()` and `isWrapperType()` to check if a given type is a primitive or a wrapper type.

It also has methods such as `wrap()` and `unwrap()` to convert a given class from a primitive type to its corresponding wrapper type, or vice versa.

The class has a private constructor to prevent instantiation, as it only provides static utility methods.

Overall, the `Primitives` class in Gson provides convenient methods for working with primitive and wrapper types in Java.
