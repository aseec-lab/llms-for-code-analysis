The file androidx/constraintlayout/widget/ConstraintsChangedListener.java defines an abstract class called ConstraintsChangedListener. It contains two empty methods, postLayoutChange and preLayoutChange, which can be overridden by subclasses. The purpose of this class is to provide a callback mechanism for notifying when layout constraints have changed in a ConstraintLayout.
