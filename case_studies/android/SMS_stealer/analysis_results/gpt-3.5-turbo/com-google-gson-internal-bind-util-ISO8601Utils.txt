The `ISO8601Utils` class provides methods for formatting and parsing dates in ISO 8601 format. The `format` method is used to convert a `Date` object to a string representation in ISO 8601 format. It supports formatting with or without milliseconds and with or without a time zone. The `parse` method is used to convert a string in ISO 8601 format to a `Date` object. It uses the `ParsePosition` parameter to keep track of the current parsing index. The `checkOffset` method is a helper method used to check if a specific character is at a given offset in the string. The `padInt` method is used to append leading zeros to an integer value to ensure it has a specific length. The `indexOfNonDigit` method is used to find the index of the first non-digit character in a string starting from a given position.The remaining part of the code includes parsing and handling of time zone indicators in the ISO 8601 format. It checks for valid time zone indicators such as 'Z', '+', and '-'. It converts the time zone string to a `TimeZone` object and sets it in a `GregorianCalendar` instance. It sets the date and time values based on the parsed string and returns a `Date` object. If any errors occur during parsing, appropriate exceptions are thrown.This portion of the code handles the parsing of the date and time values from the input string. It uses utility methods to convert the string values into integers and performs error handling for invalid values.
