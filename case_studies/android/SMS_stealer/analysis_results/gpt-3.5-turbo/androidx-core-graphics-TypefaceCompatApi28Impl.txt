The `TypefaceCompatApi28Impl` class in the `androidx.core.graphics` package provides implementation for compatibility with Android API level 28 and above for managing Typeface objects.

Here's a summary of the code:

- The class extends the `TypefaceCompatApi26Impl` class, which itself extends `TypefaceCompatBaseImpl` and provides support for Typeface compatibility with API level 26 and above.
- The class defines several constants, including the name of a method used for creating Typeface objects, the default typeface family, and a constant for resolving typefaces using a font table.
- The `createFromFamiliesWithDefault` method creates a Typeface from a font family object by using reflection to invoke the `createFromFamiliesWithDefault` method on `Typeface` class. It wraps the font family object in an array and passes it along with other parameters to the method invocation.
- The `obtainCreateFromFamiliesWithDefaultMethod` method obtains the `createFromFamiliesWithDefault` method from the `Typeface` class using reflection. It creates a new array instance of the provided font class, retrieves the method with matching parameter types, and makes it accessible for invocation.
