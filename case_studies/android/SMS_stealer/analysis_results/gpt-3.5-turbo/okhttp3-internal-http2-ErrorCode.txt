The `ErrorCode` class is an enum that represents the error codes defined in the HTTP/2 protocol. It contains a list of error codes and their corresponding HTTP codes.

Each error code is represented as a constant in the enum. The enum also contains a static initializer block that assigns unique values to each constant and creates an array of all the error codes.

The `httpCode` field represents the corresponding HTTP status code for each error code.

The enum provides a `fromHttp2` method that takes an HTTP/2 error code as input and returns the corresponding `ErrorCode` enum constant. If the input code doesn't match any existing error code, `null` is returned.
