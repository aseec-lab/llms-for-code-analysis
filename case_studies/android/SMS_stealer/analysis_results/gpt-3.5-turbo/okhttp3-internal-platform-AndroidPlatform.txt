The `AndroidPlatform` class is a subclass of `Platform` that provides platform-specific implementations for Android. 

It includes methods for supporting various features such as handling TLS extensions, configuring TLS connections, managing certificate chains, checking if cleartext traffic is permitted, logging, and more.

The `supportsAlpn` method checks if ALPN (Application-Layer Protocol Negotiation) is supported by the Android platform.

The `connectSocket` method establishes a socket connection to a specified address.

The `getSelectedProtocol` method returns the selected ALPN protocol for a given SSL socket.

The `isCleartextTrafficPermitted` method checks if cleartext traffic is permitted for a specified hostname.

The `log` method logs messages with different log levels.

The `logCloseableLeak` method logs a warning if a closeable resource is not properly closed.

The `trustManager` method retrieves the X509 trust manager from the specified SSL socket factory.

These are just a few highlights from the `AndroidPlatform` class. The full implementation includes additional methods and logic for handling various platform-specific functionalities.The `AndroidCertificateChainCleaner` class is a utility class that cleans up a list of certificates. It implements the `CertificateChainCleaner` interface.

The `clean` method takes a list of certificates and a hostname and returns a cleaned list of certificates.

The `equals` method compares two `AndroidCertificateChainCleaner` objects for equality.

The `hashCode` method returns the hash code of the `AndroidCertificateChainCleaner` object.

The `AndroidTrustRootIndex` class implements the `TrustRootIndex` interface and provides a method (`findByIssuerAndSignature`) to find a certificate by its issuer and signature.

The `equals` method compares two `AndroidTrustRootIndex` objects for equality.

The `hashCode` method returns the hash code of the `AndroidTrustRootIndex` object.

The `CloseGuard` class is a utility class for managing closeable resources. It provides methods to create and open closeable objects, as well as warn if a closeable object is still open.

The `get` method returns an instance of the `CloseGuard` class.

The `createAndOpen` method creates and opens a new closeable object with a given name.

The `warnIfOpen` method warns if a closeable object is still open.

These are the remaining parts of the code.
