The code snippet represents the `PluralsRes` annotation, which is defined in the `androidx.annotation` package. 

This annotation is used to mark an element as representing a plurals resource. It can be applied to methods, parameters, fields, and local variables.

The `PluralsRes` annotation has a retention policy of `RetentionPolicy.CLASS`, meaning it is retained in the compiled bytecode.

The code also includes some comments indicating the file location, Java compiler version, and JD-Core version.
