The `ExclusionStrategy` interface is part of the Gson library. It defines two methods:

1. `boolean shouldSkipClass(Class<?> paramClass)`: This method is used to determine whether a specific class should be excluded from serialization or deserialization. It takes a `Class` parameter and returns a `boolean` value indicating whether the class should be skipped.

2. `boolean shouldSkipField(FieldAttributes paramFieldAttributes)`: This method is used to determine whether a specific field should be excluded from serialization or deserialization. It takes a `FieldAttributes` parameter and returns a `boolean` value indicating whether the field should be skipped.

The code does not contain any implementation of these methods, as it is an interface. The code also includes comments about the location and version of the Java compiler.
