The `AppCompatDrawableManager` class is responsible for managing drawable resources in the AppCompat library. It provides methods for obtaining drawables, tinting drawables, and getting tint lists for drawables.

The class has a singleton instance and can be accessed through the `get()` method. It also has a `preload()` method that initializes the singleton instance and sets up the resource manager.

The class provides methods for obtaining drawables and tint lists, as well as for tinting drawables using color filters. It also has a method for handling configuration changes.

The `onDrawableLoadedFromResources()` method is called when a drawable is loaded from resources, and it performs any necessary modifications or tinting.

The class uses the `ResourceManagerInternal` class for the actual resource management operations.
