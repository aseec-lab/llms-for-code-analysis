The `MotionInterpolator` class is an abstract class that extends the `Interpolator` interface. It provides a way to customize the interpolation and velocity behavior of animations in the MotionLayout library.

This class requires implementing two methods:

- `getInterpolation(float paramFloat)`: This method takes a float value representing the progress of the animation and returns a float value representing the interpolated value. It can be used to customize the animation's behavior.

- `getVelocity()`: This method returns the velocity of the animation.

Overall, the `MotionInterpolator` class allows developers to create custom interpolation behaviors for animations in MotionLayout.
