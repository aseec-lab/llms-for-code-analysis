The `AutoScrollHelper` class in the `androidx.core.widget` package provides functionality for automatically scrolling a view in response to touch actions.

Key features of the code:

- The class extends `View.OnTouchListener` and can be used to handle touch events for a specific view.
- It allows scrolling in both horizontal and vertical directions.
- The scrolling behavior can be customized based on various properties such as activation delay, edge type, maximum and minimum velocity, and relative edges and velocity.
- The class uses a `ClampedScroller` instance to calculate and handle the scrolling animations.
- The `onTouch` method is implemented to detect touch events and initiate scrolling based on the touch position and view dimensions.
- The `startAnimating` method starts the scrolling animations.
- The `cancelTargetTouch` method cancels the touch event being handled.

Overall, the code provides a flexible and customizable solution for implementing automatic scrolling behavior for a view.The remaining part of the code introduces two additional inner classes: `ClampedScroller` and `ScrollAnimationRunnable`.

The `ClampedScroller` is a private inner class that handles the calculation and animation of scroll deltas. It provides methods to start, stop, and compute the scroll deltas based on the current target velocity.

The `ScrollAnimationRunnable` is a nested class that implements the `Runnable` interface. It is used to initiate and control the scrolling animations. It runs in a loop until the animations are finished or explicitly cancelled. The `scrollTargetBy` method is called to update the target view's scroll position based on the computed deltas.

Both of these inner classes contribute to the automatic scrolling functionality by managing the scroll animations and updating the view's scroll position accordingly.
