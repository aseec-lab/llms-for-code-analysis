The `$Gson$Types` class in the `com.google.gson.internal` package provides utility methods for working with types in Gson. It contains methods for creating generic array types, canonicalizing types, checking if a type is primitive, getting the array component type, getting the element type of a collection, getting the key and value types of a map, getting the raw type of a parameterized type, resolving types, and checking type equality. The class is final and has a private constructor, making it a utility class that cannot be instantiated.This code defines several utility classes and methods for working with types in Gson. 

- The `GenericArrayTypeImpl` class implements the `GenericArrayType` interface, representing a generic array type.
- The `ParameterizedTypeImpl` class implements the `ParameterizedType` interface, representing a parameterized type.
- The `WildcardTypeImpl` class implements the `WildcardType` interface, representing a wildcard type.
- The `resolve()` method resolves the actual type arguments for a generic type.
- The `resolveTypeVariable()` method resolves a type variable to its actual type.
- The `subtypeOf()` method creates a `WildcardType` representing a subtype of a given type.
- The `supertypeOf()` method creates a `WildcardType` representing a supertype of a given type.
- The `typeToString()` method converts a type to its string representation.

These utility classes and methods are used internally by Gson when handling types.This code is part of the Gson library and is used for working with types in Java. It includes several utility classes and methods for handling generic types, parameterized types, and wildcard types. These utility classes are used internally by Gson to parse and serialize JSON data to Java objects, taking into account the generic type information. The code is written to be compatible with Java 6 and uses the JD-Core library version 1.1.3 for decompilation purposes.
