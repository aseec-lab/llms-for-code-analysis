The "HttpDate.java" file in the OkHttp library contains a set of utility methods for working with HTTP dates.

The class defines a set of date format patterns and formats a given Date object into a string representation using the standard date format.

It also provides a parse method that attempts to parse a given string representation of a date into a Date object. It first tries to parse the date using the standard date format, and if that fails, it goes through a list of browser-compatible date format patterns and tries to parse the date with each pattern until a match is found.

The class uses thread-safe instances of DateFormat objects to ensure safe concurrent access.
