The "RealResponseBody.java" file in the OkHttp library is a class that represents the response body of an HTTP response.

It extends the OkHttp library's ResponseBody class and implements the contentLength and contentType methods.

The class has three private fields: contentLength, contentTypeString, and source. The contentLength field stores the length of the response body, the contentTypeString field stores the string representation of the content type, and the source field stores the source of the response body.

The class has a constructor that takes in a content type string, a content length, and a buffered source, and initializes the corresponding fields with the provided values.

The contentLength method returns the value of the contentLength field.

The contentType method parses the contentTypeString field and returns a MediaType object representing the content type.

The source method returns the value of the source field.
