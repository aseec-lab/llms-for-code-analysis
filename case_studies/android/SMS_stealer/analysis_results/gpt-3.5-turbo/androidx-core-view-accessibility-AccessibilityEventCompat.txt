The `AccessibilityEventCompat` class in the `androidx.core.view.accessibility` package provides compatibility methods for working with `AccessibilityEvent` objects. It includes methods for getting and setting various properties and attributes of accessibility events, such as action, content change types, and movement granularity. It also includes methods for converting `AccessibilityEvent` objects to `AccessibilityRecordCompat` objects and vice versa, as well as for appending a `AccessibilityRecordCompat` object to an `AccessibilityEvent` object.
