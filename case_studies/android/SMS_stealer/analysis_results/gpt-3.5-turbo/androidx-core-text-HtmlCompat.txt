The `HtmlCompat` class in the `androidx.core.text` package provides compatibility methods for working with HTML text in Android. It includes methods for converting HTML strings to `Spanned` objects and vice versa. The class also defines constants for specifying various options and modes for HTML parsing.

- The `fromHtml` method is used to convert an HTML string to a `Spanned` object. It has two overloaded versions, one with just the HTML string and the other with additional parameters for image getter and tag handler. The method checks the Android version and uses the appropriate `Html.fromHtml` method from the `android.text.Html` class.

- The `toHtml` method is used to convert a `Spanned` object to an HTML string. It also has two overloaded versions, one with just the `Spanned` object and the other with an additional parameter for specifying paragraph line behavior. The method checks the Android version and uses the appropriate `Html.toHtml` method from the `android.text.Html` class.

- The class also defines several constants for specifying options and modes for HTML parsing, such as specifying line breaks for different HTML elements, and using CSS colors.

Overall, the `HtmlCompat` class provides a compatibility layer for working with HTML text in a consistent manner across different versions of Android.
