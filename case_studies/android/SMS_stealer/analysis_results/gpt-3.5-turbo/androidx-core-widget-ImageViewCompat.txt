The code in the `ImageViewCompat` class provides compatibility methods for working with tinting of `ImageViews`. 

- The `getImageTintList` method returns the tint color state list of an `ImageView`, taking into account different versions of the Android SDK.
- The `getImageTintMode` method returns the tint mode of an `ImageView`, again taking into account different SDK versions.
- The `setImageTintList` method sets the tint color state list of an `ImageView`, considering different SDK versions. It also handles older versions of the SDK by applying the tint directly to the `Drawable` if necessary.
- The `setImageTintMode` method sets the tint mode of an `ImageView`, considering different SDK versions. It also handles older versions of the SDK by applying the tint directly to the `Drawable` if necessary.
