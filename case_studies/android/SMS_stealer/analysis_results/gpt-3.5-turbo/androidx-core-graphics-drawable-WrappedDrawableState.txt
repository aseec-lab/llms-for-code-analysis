The `WrappedDrawableState` class is used to store the state of a wrapped drawable. It extends from `Drawable.ConstantState` and contains fields for changing configurations, drawable state, tint, and tint mode. It has constructors to initialize its fields and methods to check if it has a constant state, get the changing configurations, and create a new drawable based on the state. It also uses different versions of the `WrappedDrawableApi` classes based on the SDK version.
