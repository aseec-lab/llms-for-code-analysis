The `MapTypeAdapterFactory` class is a Gson type adapter factory that provides functionality to serialize and deserialize Maps. It implements the `TypeAdapterFactory` interface and includes a nested `Adapter` class that is responsible for reading and writing Map objects. The class handles complex map key serialization and uses various Gson libraries and classes, such as `TypeAdapter`, `JsonElement`, and `JsonWriter`, to perform the serialization and deserialization operations.
