The `RunGroup` class is part of the `androidx.constraintlayout.solver.widgets.analyzer` package. It represents a group of widget runs that are analyzed together.

Here are the key features of the `RunGroup` class:

- The class has constants for three types of directions: `START`, `END`, and `BASELINE`.
- The class has a static `index` variable to keep track of the group index.
- The class has instance variables for the group's direction, whether it's a dual group, the first and last runs in the group, the group's position, and a list of runs in the group.
- The class has a constructor to initialize the group with a first run and a direction.
- The class has methods to define terminal widgets, traverse starts and ends of dependency nodes, add runs to the group, and compute the wrap size of the group.
- The class has a method to define terminal widgets based on whether they are horizontal or vertical.
