The `StreamResetException` class extends the `IOException` class and represents an exception that is thrown when a stream is reset in the HTTP/2 protocol. It has a field `errorCode` of type `ErrorCode` that represents the error code associated with the stream reset.

The constructor of the class takes an `ErrorCode` parameter and initializes the `errorCode` field with it. It also initializes the `message` field of the superclass `IOException` with a dynamically generated message based on the error code.

The code file is located at `okhttp3/internal/http2/StreamResetException.java` and is compiled with Java version 6.
