The `Consumer` interface in the `androidx.core.util` package is a functional interface that defines a single method `accept(T paramT)`. 

The purpose of this interface is to provide a way to represent an operation that accepts a single input parameter of type `T` and returns no result. The `accept()` method can be implemented by any class that wants to act as a consumer and performs some action on the input parameter.
