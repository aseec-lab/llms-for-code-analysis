The `Http2Stream` class represents an HTTP/2 stream in an `Http2Connection`. It manages the state and operations related to a single stream, such as sending and receiving data.

The class has several fields including `bytesLeftInWriteWindow` to track the available space in the write window, `errorCode` to store the error code if the stream is closed due to an error, and `requestHeaders` and `responseHeaders` to store the headers of the request and response.

It provides methods to close the stream (`close()` and `closeLater()`), get the connection it belongs to (`getConnection()`), get the error code if the stream is closed (`getErrorCode()`), get the stream ID (`getId()`), get the request headers (`getRequestHeaders()`), and get the source and sink for reading from and writing to the stream (`getSource()` and `getSink()`).

The class also has internal methods to perform operations such as adding bytes to the write window (`addBytesToWriteWindow()`), canceling the stream if necessary (`cancelStreamIfNecessary()`), and checking if the stream is closed or finished (`checkOutNotClosed()`).The `waitForIo()` method is called by the `takeResponseHeaders()` method to wait for I/O operations to complete. It is used in a loop to wait until the response headers are available or an error occurs. If a response header is received or an error code is set, the method exits and returns. If the read timeout occurs while waiting, it throws an `InterruptedIOException`.The `FramingSink` class implements the `Sink` interface and is responsible for writing data to the network for an HTTP/2 stream. It has a `write()` method to write data to the send buffer and an `emitFrame()` method to send a framed message. The `close()` method is called to close the sink and flush any remaining data to the network.

The `FramingSource` class implements the `Source` interface and is responsible for reading data from the network for an HTTP/2 stream. It has a `read()` method to read data from the read buffer and a `receive()` method to receive data from the network. The `close()` method is called to close the source.

The `StreamTimeout` class extends `AsyncTimeout` and is a helper class to manage the timeout for an HTTP/2 stream. It provides methods to check if the timeout has occurred and to throw an exception if it has. The `timedOut()` method is called when the timeout occurs and is responsible for closing the stream.
