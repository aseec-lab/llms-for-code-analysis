The code provided is a class called `CustomVersionedParcelable` in the `androidx.versionedparcelable` package. This class is an abstract implementation of the `VersionedParcelable` interface.

The `CustomVersionedParcelable` class defines two methods:
- `onPostParceling()`: This method has an empty implementation. Subclasses can override this method to perform any post-parceling actions.
- `onPreParceling(boolean paramBoolean)`: This method has an empty implementation. Subclasses can override this method to perform any pre-parceling actions.

This class does not contain any additional logic or behavior. It serves as a base class for versioned parcelable objects and provides two empty methods that can be overridden by subclasses for custom parceling behavior.
