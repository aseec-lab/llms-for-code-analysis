The code defines an interface called `UploadProgressListener`, which is a part of the `com.androidnetworking.interfaces` package.

This interface declares one method:
1. `onProgress(long paramLong1, long paramLong2)`: This method is called to notify the progress of an upload. It takes two parameters: `paramLong1`, which represents the current progress of the upload, and `paramLong2`, which represents the total size of the upload.

The purpose of this interface is to provide a mechanism for listening to upload progress and performing actions based on the progress updates.
