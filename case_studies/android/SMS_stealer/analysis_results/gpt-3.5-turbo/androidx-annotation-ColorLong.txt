The code defines the `ColorLong` annotation in the `androidx.annotation` package. This annotation is used to annotate parameters, methods, local variables, and fields that represent long integers representing colors. The annotation has a retention policy of `RetentionPolicy.SOURCE`, meaning it is only retained in the source code and is not accessible at runtime.
