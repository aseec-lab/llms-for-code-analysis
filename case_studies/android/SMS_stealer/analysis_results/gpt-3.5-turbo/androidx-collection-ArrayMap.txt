The `ArrayMap` class is a Java implementation of a map data structure using an array for internal storage. It extends the `SimpleArrayMap` class and implements the `Map` interface.

The class has multiple constructors to create new instances of `ArrayMap` with different initial capacities. It also provides a private method `getCollection()` that returns a `MapCollections` object to handle various map operation.

The class overrides several methods from the `Map` interface, such as `containsAll()`, `entrySet()`, `keySet()`, `putAll()`, `removeAll()`, `retainAll()`, and `values()`. These methods delegate the actual implementation to the `MapCollections` object obtained from the `getCollection()` method.

The `ArrayMap` class provides functionalities to check if it contains all elements in a collection, retrieve the entry set, key set, and values of the map, add all key-value pairs from another map, remove all elements in a collection from the map, retain only the elements in the map that are also in a collection, and return a collection of values.

The code is part of the androidx.collection package and is located in the ArrayMap.java file.
