The `MultipartBody.java` file in the `okhttp3` package defines the `MultipartBody` class, which represents a request body for multipart form data. Here is a summary of the code:

- The class extends the `RequestBody` class, which is a base class for HTTP request bodies.
- It defines constants for various media types such as "multipart/mixed", "multipart/form-data", etc.
- The class has private fields for the boundary, content length, content type, original type, and list of parts.
- It has a static initializer block that initializes the media type constants.
- The constructor is package-private and is called with the boundary, media type, and list of parts.
- There is a static method `appendQuotedString` that appends a quoted string to a `StringBuilder` object.
- The class has a private method `writeOrCountBytes` that writes the multipart form data to a buffer or counts the number of bytes if `paramBoolean` is true.
- The class provides getter methods for the boundary, content length, content type, parts, and original type.
- It implements the `writeTo` method to write the multipart form data to a `BufferedSink`.
- It overrides the `contentLength` method to calculate and return the content length.
- The inner class `Builder` is a builder for creating `MultipartBody` objects.
- The inner class `Part` represents a part of the multipart form data and includes the headers and body of the part. It has a constructor and static factory methods for creating instances of `Part`.
