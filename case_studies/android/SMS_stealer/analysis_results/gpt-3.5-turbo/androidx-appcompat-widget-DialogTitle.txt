The code defines a custom class called `DialogTitle` which extends `AppCompatTextView`. It is used to create a title for a dialog.

The class has three constructors, each of which calls the corresponding superclass constructor.

The `onMeasure()` method is overridden to customize the measurement behavior of the view. It checks if the text of the view is ellipsized and if so, it sets the view to be multiline with a maximum of two lines. It also retrieves the text size from the theme attributes and applies it to the view.

Overall, the code is responsible for setting the behavior and appearance of a dialog title view.
