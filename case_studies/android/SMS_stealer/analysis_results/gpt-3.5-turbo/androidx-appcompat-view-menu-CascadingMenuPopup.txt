The `CascadingMenuPopup` class is a menu popup that displays a cascading menu. It implements the `MenuPresenter`, `View.OnKeyListener`, and `PopupWindow.OnDismissListener` interfaces and extends the `MenuPopup` class.

The class provides methods for creating a popup window, finding the index of added menus, finding a parent view for a submenu, and finding a menu item for a submenu.

It also includes various fields such as the anchor view, the popup style attribute and resource, the menu max width, a list of showing menus, and a reference to a submenu hover handler.

The class has a constructor that takes a context, an anchor view, a popup style attribute, a popup style resource, and a boolean indicating whether the popup should only show overflow items. It initializes various fields and creates a submenu hover handler.

Overall, the `CascadingMenuPopup` class is responsible for managing the display and behavior of a cascading menu popup.The remaining part of the code implements the `showMenu()` method. It creates a `MenuAdapter` to populate the menu items, sets the adapter and content width of the popup window, and sets the dropdown gravity. It then determines the position of the popup window relative to the anchor view and sets the horizontal and vertical offsets accordingly. Finally, it creates a new `CascadingMenuInfo` object to store information about the popup and adds it to the list of showing menus. The popup window is shown and the `OnKeyListener` is set on the list view. If the menu has a header title, it is inflated and added to the top of the list view.The `CascadingMenuPopup` class is responsible for displaying cascading menus. It extends `MenuPopup` and implements various methods for showing, dismissing, and updating the menu. The class also defines a nested `CascadingMenuInfo` class to store information about each cascading menu.
