This code is a class called `FragmentTransitionCompat21` in the `androidx.fragment.app` package. It is a compatibility implementation of fragment transitions for API level 21 and above. 

The class implements the `FragmentTransitionImpl` interface and overrides its methods. 

The methods in this class handle adding, removing, and replacing targets for transitions, scheduling hiding of fragment views, setting epicenter for transitions, merging and cloning transitions, and wrapping transitions in a transition set. 

It uses the `Transition` and `TransitionSet` classes from the Android framework to perform these operations.
