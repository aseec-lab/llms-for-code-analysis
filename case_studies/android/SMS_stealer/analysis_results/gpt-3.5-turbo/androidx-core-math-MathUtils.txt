The code defines a class called MathUtils in the package androidx.core.math.

The class provides static methods for clamping values to a specified range. There are overloaded methods for clamping double, float, int, and long values.

The clamp method takes three parameters: the value to be clamped, the lower bound of the range, and the upper bound of the range. It returns the clamped value, which is the original value if it is within the range, or the closest bound if it is outside the range.

The purpose of this class is to provide a convenient way to restrict values to a specific range, ensuring they do not exceed the specified bounds.
