The `SolverVariableValues` class in the `androidx.constraintlayout.solver` package is responsible for managing the values of solver variables used in solving linear equations. Some key features of this class include:

- It stores the variables and their corresponding values in arrays.
- It provides methods for adding and removing variables.
- It allows for retrieving the value of a variable.
- It supports division of all variable values by a given amount.
- It can check if a variable is contained in the solver variable values.
- It can display the variables and their values.The `indexOf` method is used to find the index of a solver variable within the `SolverVariableValues` object.

The `invert` method is used to invert the sign of all the values in the `SolverVariableValues` object.

The `put` method is used to add or update the value of a solver variable in the `SolverVariableValues` object.

The `remove` method is used to remove a solver variable and its corresponding value from the `SolverVariableValues` object.

The `sizeInBytes` method returns the size of the `SolverVariableValues` object in bytes.

The `toString` method provides a string representation of the `SolverVariableValues` object.

The `use` method is used to transfer the variables and their values from one `ArrayRow` object to another.
