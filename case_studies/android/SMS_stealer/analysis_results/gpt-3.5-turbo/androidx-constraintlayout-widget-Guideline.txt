The `Guideline` class is a subclass of `View` in the `androidx.constraintlayout.widget` package. It represents a guideline in a `ConstraintLayout` and provides methods to set the position and visibility of the guideline.

The class has four constructors that call the corresponding super constructors in `View`. The visibility of the guideline is set to `GONE` (`8` in the Android framework) in each constructor.

The `draw` method is overridden and left empty, indicating that the guideline does not have any custom drawing.

The `onMeasure` method is overridden to set the measured dimensions of the guideline to 0.

The class provides methods to set the position of the guideline using either a fixed begin or end position, or a percentage position. These methods update the guideline position in the `ConstraintLayout.LayoutParams` and update the layout parameters of the guideline.

The `setVisibility` method is overridden but left empty, indicating that the visibility of the guideline is not modified in this method.
