The `Group` class is a subclass of `ConstraintHelper` in the `androidx.constraintlayout.widget` package. It extends the functionality of a `ConstraintHelper` to allow users to group views together for layout purposes.

The class has three constructors that call the corresponding super constructors in `ConstraintHelper`. The `init` method is overridden to disable the view measure for the group.

The `onAttachedToWindow` method is overridden to call the `applyLayoutFeatures` method of the super class.

The `setElevation` and `setVisibility` methods are overridden to call the `applyLayoutFeatures` method of the super class.

The `updatePostLayout` method is overridden to set the width and height of the `ConstraintLayout.LayoutParams` widget to 0.

Overall, the `Group` class provides additional functionality to the `ConstraintHelper` class specifically for grouping views together in a `ConstraintLayout`.
