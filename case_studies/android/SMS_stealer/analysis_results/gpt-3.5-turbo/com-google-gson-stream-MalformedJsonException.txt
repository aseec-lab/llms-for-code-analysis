The `MalformedJsonException` class is a subclass of `IOException` and is used to indicate that the JSON data being parsed is malformed or invalid.

The class has three constructors:
- The first constructor takes a `String` parameter which represents the error message and calls the constructor of the superclass (`IOException`) with the provided message.
- The second constructor takes a `String` parameter for the error message and a `Throwable` parameter for the cause of the exception. It calls the constructor of the superclass (`IOException`) with the provided message and then sets the cause of the exception.
- The third constructor takes a `Throwable` parameter for the cause of the exception. It sets the cause of the exception.

The class has a `serialVersionUID` field which is a unique identifier for the specific version of the class.
