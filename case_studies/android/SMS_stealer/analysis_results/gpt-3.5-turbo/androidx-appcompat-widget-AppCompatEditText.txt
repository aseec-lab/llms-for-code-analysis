The `AppCompatEditText` class is a subclass of `EditText` that provides compatibility backports for certain features on different Android versions. It implements the `TintableBackgroundView` interface.

The class initializes three helper objects (`AppCompatBackgroundHelper`, `AppCompatTextClassifierHelper`, and `AppCompatTextHelper`) to handle tinting and other functionality for the EditText.

It overrides some methods related to drawable state changes, getting and setting background drawable, and handling text appearance and text classifier.

The class also provides methods to get and set the tint color and mode for the EditText's background and set a custom selection action mode callback.
