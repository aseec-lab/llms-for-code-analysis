The `GuardedBy` annotation is used to annotate fields and methods in the `androidx.annotation` package. It is a `@Retention` annotation with a policy of `CLASS`, meaning it is retained during compile time and available for inspection at runtime. It is also `@Target`ed at `ElementType.FIELD` and `ElementType.METHOD`, meaning it can be applied to field and method declarations. This annotation is used to indicate that the annotated field or method is guarded by a specific lock or synchronization resource, specified by the `value()` attribute.
