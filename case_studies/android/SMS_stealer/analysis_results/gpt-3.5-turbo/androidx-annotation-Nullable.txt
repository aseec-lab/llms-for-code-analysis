The `Nullable` annotation is defined in the `androidx.annotation` package.

This annotation is used to annotate methods, parameters, fields, local variables, annotation types, and packages where a null value is allowed.

It is a `@Retention` annotation with a policy of `CLASS`, which means it will be retained during compile time and available for inspection via reflection at runtime.

This annotation is also `@Documented`, which means it will be included in the generated API documentation.

The `@Target` annotation specifies that this annotation can be applied to methods, parameters, fields, local variables, annotation types, and packages.

The purpose of this annotation is to provide clear documentation and enforce proper usage of nullable values in the codebase.
