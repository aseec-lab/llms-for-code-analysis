The `EdgeEffectCompat` class in the `androidx.core.widget` package provides compatibility methods for working with edge effects in Android. It includes methods for creating and manipulating edge effects, such as pulling, drawing, finishing, and checking if the effect is finished.

- The `EdgeEffectCompat` constructor initializes an instance of `EdgeEffect` with the given `Context` parameter.

- The `onPull` method is used to apply a pulling effect to the `EdgeEffect`. It determines the appropriate method to call based on the Android version.

- The `draw` method draws the `EdgeEffect` on a `Canvas`.

- The `finish` method finishes the `EdgeEffect` and resets it.

- The `isFinished` method checks if the `EdgeEffect` is finished.

- The `onAbsorb` method applies an absorbing effect to the `EdgeEffect`.

- The `onRelease` method releases the `EdgeEffect` and checks if it is finished.

- The `setSize` method sets the size of the `EdgeEffect`.

Overall, the `EdgeEffectCompat` class provides a compatibility layer for working with edge effects in a consistent manner across different versions of Android.
