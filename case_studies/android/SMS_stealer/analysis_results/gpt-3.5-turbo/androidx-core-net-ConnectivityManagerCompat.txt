The `ConnectivityManagerCompat` class in the `androidx.core.net` package provides compatibility methods for working with the `ConnectivityManager` class in Android. It contains the following methods:

1. `getNetworkInfoFromBroadcast`: This method returns the `NetworkInfo` object associated with a network broadcast intent by retrieving it from the intent's extras.
2. `getRestrictBackgroundStatus`: This method returns the background restriction status of the device. It checks the Android SDK version and calls the corresponding method to retrieve the background restriction status.
3. `isActiveNetworkMetered`: This method checks if the currently active network is metered or not. It checks the Android SDK version and calls the respective method to get the active network info and determine if it is metered.

The class also includes a nested `RestrictBackgroundStatus` annotation, which is used to annotate the valid values for the background restriction status.

Note: The code snippet you provided only includes the method signatures and annotations, so the actual implementation details are missing.
