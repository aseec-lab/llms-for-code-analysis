The `WebSocketReader` class is responsible for reading frames from a WebSocket connection. It maintains state information about the frame being processed, such as the frame length, opcode, and whether it is a control frame.

The class provides methods to read control frames and message frames. Control frames include PING, PONG, and CLOSE frames, while message frames can be either text or binary messages. The class also provides a callback interface (`FrameCallback`) to notify the client of events, such as when a frame is received or when the connection is closed.

Overall, the `WebSocketReader` class is responsible for parsing incoming frames from a WebSocket connection and notifying the client of relevant events.
