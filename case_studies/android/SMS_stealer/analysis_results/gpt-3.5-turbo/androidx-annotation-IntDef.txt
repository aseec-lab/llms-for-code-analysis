The `IntDef` annotation is defined in the `androidx.annotation` package. It is used to restrict an integer value to a specific set of constants.

The `IntDef` annotation has a retention policy of `RetentionPolicy.SOURCE`, meaning it is only available at compile-time and is not retained in the compiled bytecode.

The `IntDef` annotation can only be applied to other annotations, as indicated by the `@Target({ElementType.ANNOTATION_TYPE})` annotation. This means it is used to define custom annotation types.

The `IntDef` annotation has the following attributes:

- `flag()`: A boolean attribute that specifies whether the defined constants can be combined using the bitwise OR operator.
- `open()`: A boolean attribute that specifies whether the defined constants are the only possible values, or if additional values may be defined.
- `value()`: An int array attribute that specifies the set of constant values that are allowed.

The code doesn't contain any functionality, it simply defines the `IntDef` annotation. The location and version information at the end are comments and not part of the code.
