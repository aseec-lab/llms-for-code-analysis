The code is a class named `connect` in the package `ir.siqe.holo`. 

The `connect` class initializes a network request using AndroidNetworking library to send data to a specified URL. It takes three parameters: `url`, `info`, and `paramContext`. 

Inside the constructor, it builds a URL string by appending the `url` and `info` parameters to a base URL. It then sends a GET request to this URL using AndroidNetworking library's `get()` method. If the request is successful, the `onResponse()` method is called, and if there is an error, the `onError()` method is called.

If an error occurs, the code logs a message and sends a similar GET request to a different URL. The response is ignored in both cases.

Overall, the `connect` class is responsible for sending data to a specified URL and handling any errors that may occur during the network request.
