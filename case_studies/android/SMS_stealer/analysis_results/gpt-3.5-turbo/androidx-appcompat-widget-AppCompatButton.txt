The `AppCompatButton` class extends the `Button` class and adds support for tinting the background and compound drawables, as well as handling text appearance and auto-sizing.

The class initializes and uses an `AppCompatBackgroundHelper` to manage background tinting and a `AppCompatTextHelper` to manage text appearance, auto-sizing, and compound drawable tinting.

It overrides several methods to handle background and text changes, accessibility events, layout, and text appearance. It also provides methods to set and get the support background tint, support compound drawable tint, and text appearance.

The class is part of the `androidx.appcompat.widget` package and is located in the `androidx/appcompat/widget/AppCompatButton.java` file in the target project.
