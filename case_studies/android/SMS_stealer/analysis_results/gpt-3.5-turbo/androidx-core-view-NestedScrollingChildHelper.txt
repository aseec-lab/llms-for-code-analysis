The `NestedScrollingChildHelper` class in the `androidx.core.view` package provides helper methods for implementing nested scrolling behavior in a child view.

The class maintains references to the nested scrolling parents for touch and non-touch events. It also stores an array to hold the consumed scroll distances.

The class provides methods for dispatching nested scrolls, flings, and pre-scrolls to the appropriate nested scrolling parent. It also provides methods for checking if there is a nested scrolling parent and if nested scrolling is enabled.

The class uses the `ViewParentCompat` class to call the corresponding nested scrolling methods on the parents.

The class also provides methods for starting and stopping nested scrolling, as well as for enabling or disabling nested scrolling.

Lastly, the class provides a method for stopping the nested scrolling when the child view is detached from the window.
