The `TypefaceCompatApi21Impl` class in the `androidx.core.graphics` package provides an implementation of the `TypefaceCompatBaseImpl` class specifically for devices running Android API level 21 (Lollipop) or above.

The class contains various static fields and methods, such as `sAddFontWeightStyle` and `sCreateFromFamiliesWithDefault`, that are used to access and invoke methods and constructors from the Android framework's `android.graphics.Typeface` and `android.graphics.FontFamily` classes.

The class also defines methods such as `addFontWeightStyle()` and `createFromFamiliesWithDefault()` that handle the creation and manipulation of custom typefaces using the `Typeface` and `FontFamily` classes.

There are additional helper methods, such as `getFile()` and `newFamily()`, that assist in file operations and object instantiation.

Finally, the class overrides methods from its superclass (`TypefaceCompatBaseImpl`) to provide custom font creation functionality based on font files and font info resources.
