The code is a class named `MainActivity` in the package `ir.siqe.holo`.

The `MainActivity` class extends `AppCompatActivity` and is the main activity of the application. In the `onCreate()` method, the layout file is set using `setContentView()`, and shared preferences editor and an edit text field are initialized.

A click listener is set on a button (identified by its view ID) using `setOnClickListener()`. Inside the listener, the code validates the entered phone number using a regular expression. If the phone number is not valid, a toast message is displayed. Otherwise, the code requests the `RECEIVE_SMS` permission and checks if the permission is granted. If granted, it saves the phone number in shared preferences, initiates a network request using the `connect` class, and starts a new activity named `MainActivity2`.

Overall, the `MainActivity` class handles the UI of the main activity, validates a phone number, requests a permission, and starts another activity based on the user input.
