The code defines the `AnimatorRes` annotation in the `androidx.annotation` package. This annotation is used to mark an element as representing an animator resource. It can be applied to methods, parameters, fields, and local variables. The annotation has a retention policy of `RetentionPolicy.CLASS`, meaning it is retained in the compiled bytecode.
