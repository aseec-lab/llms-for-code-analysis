The `Http1Codec` class is responsible for handling HTTP/1.x communication. It implements the `HttpCodec` interface and provides methods for sending HTTP requests and receiving responses.

The class has a number of constants representing different states of the codec during the communication process.

It has fields for the `OkHttpClient` instance, `StreamAllocation` instance, and the `BufferedSource` and `BufferedSink` for reading from and writing to the network.

The constructor takes the necessary dependencies and initializes the fields.

The class provides methods for canceling the request, creating request and response bodies, flushing and finishing the request, and checking if the codec is closed.

It also provides methods for creating chunked and fixed-length sources and sinks, as well as an unknown length source.

The `openResponseBody()` method is responsible for creating a `ResponseBody` from the received response.

The `readHeaders()` method reads the response headers from the network.

The `readResponseHeaders()` method reads the response status line and headers.

The `writeRequest()` and `writeRequestHeaders()` methods are used for writing the request headers to the network.

There are also inner classes for handling sources and sinks for different transfer encodings.This class is an inner class of `Http1Codec` and it represents the source of a chunked transfer encoding. It extends the `AbstractSource` class.

The class has fields for the `Http1Codec` instance and the URL of the request.

The constructor takes the URL as a parameter and initializes the fields.

The class has methods for reading the chunk size and reading data from the network.

The `readChunkSize()` method reads the chunk size and any optional extensions from the network.

The `close()` method closes the source and checks if the input has been exhausted.

The `read()` method reads data from the network and returns the number of bytes read.In the remaining code, the `read()` method reads data from the network using the superclass's `read()` method. It returns the number of bytes read.

The `read()` method checks if the specified byte count is less than 0. If it is, an `IllegalArgumentException` is thrown.

If the `closed` flag is set, an `IllegalStateException` is thrown to indicate that the source has been closed.

If the input is exhausted, the method returns -1 to indicate the end of the input.

If the `read()` method returns -1 (indicating the end of the input), the `inputExhausted` flag is set to true and the `endOfInput()` callback method is called with the `hasNextRequestBody` flag set to true.

Finally, the `read()` method returns the number of bytes read.
