The `RouteSelector` class is responsible for selecting the appropriate network route to establish a connection for an HTTP request. It chooses from a list of proxies and socket addresses based on the provided `Address`, `RouteDatabase`, `Call`, and `EventListener`. The class maintains the state of the current proxy and socket address, and keeps track of postponed routes in case the initial choices fail. The `Selection` nested class is used to represent a collection of possible routes to choose from.
