The code defines the `CallSuper` annotation in the `androidx.annotation` package. This annotation is used to mark a method as requiring its subclasses to call the superclass implementation of the method. It can only be applied to methods. The annotation has a retention policy of `RetentionPolicy.CLASS`, meaning it is retained in the compiled bytecode.
