The code snippet is an interface named `JsonDeserializer` in the `com.google.gson` package. 

This interface is part of the Gson library and is used for deserializing JSON into objects.

The `JsonDeserializer` interface has a single method called `deserialize`. This method takes three parameters:
- `paramJsonElement`: a `JsonElement` representing the JSON to be deserialized.
- `paramType`: a `Type` object representing the type of the object to be deserialized.
- `paramJsonDeserializationContext`: a `JsonDeserializationContext` object providing context information during deserialization.

The `deserialize` method returns an object of type `T`, which represents the deserialized JSON.

The `deserialize` method may throw a `JsonParseException` if there are any errors during deserialization.

Overall, this interface defines the contract for classes that can deserialize JSON into objects using Gson.
