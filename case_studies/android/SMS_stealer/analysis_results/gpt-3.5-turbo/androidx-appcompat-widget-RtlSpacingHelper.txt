The `RtlSpacingHelper` class in the package `androidx.appcompat.widget` is responsible for managing RTL (Right-To-Left) spacing. 

The class contains several private instance variables to store the left, right, start, end, explicit left, explicit right, and flags for relative and RTL direction.

The class also defines getter methods for retrieving the left, right, start, and end spacing values.

It provides a `setAbsolute()` method to set the left and right spacing values in an absolute manner.

The `setDirection()` method is used to set the RTL direction, which updates the left and right spacing values accordingly.

The `setRelative()` method is used to set the start and end spacing values in a relative manner based on RTL direction.
