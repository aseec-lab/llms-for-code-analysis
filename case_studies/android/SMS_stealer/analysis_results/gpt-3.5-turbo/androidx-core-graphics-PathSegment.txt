The `PathSegment` class in the `androidx.core.graphics` package represents a segment of a path. It stores the start and end points of the segment, as well as the fractional positions of the start and end points along the path.

The class provides methods to retrieve the start and end points, as well as their fractional positions. It also overrides the `equals()`, `hashCode()`, and `toString()` methods for object comparison and string representation.

Overall, the `PathSegment` class is a simple data structure used to represent a segment of a path in graphics operations.
