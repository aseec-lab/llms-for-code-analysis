The `ServiceCompat` class in the `androidx.core.app` package provides compatibility methods for working with services in Android apps.
It defines three constants: `START_STICKY`, `STOP_FOREGROUND_DETACH`, and `STOP_FOREGROUND_REMOVE`.
The `stopForeground()` method is used to stop a service from running in the foreground. It checks the Android version and calls the appropriate method based on the version.
The `StopForegroundFlags` annotation is used to mark the retention policy for the constants defined in the class.
