The `FastOutSlowInInterpolator` class is a subclass of the `LookupTableInterpolator` class. It provides an implementation of an interpolator that uses a lookup table for interpolating values.

The `FastOutSlowInInterpolator` class initializes a static float array called `VALUES` that contains a lookup table of values for interpolation. The array represents the mapping of input values to output values.

The constructor of the `FastOutSlowInInterpolator` class calls the superclass constructor, passing in the `VALUES` array as a parameter. This sets up the lookup table in the base `LookupTableInterpolator` class.

Overall, the `FastOutSlowInInterpolator` class provides a predefined interpolation curve derived from a lookup table, which can be used for smooth animation transitions.
