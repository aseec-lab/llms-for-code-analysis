The `FastSafeIterableMap` class in the `androidx.arch.core.internal` package extends the `SafeIterableMap` class and provides a fast and safe iterable map implementation.

1. It has a private `mHashMap` variable of type `HashMap` to store the entries of the map.
2. The `ceil(K paramK)` method returns the entry with the key equal to or immediately greater than the given key.
3. The `contains(K paramK)` method checks if the map contains an entry with the given key.
4. The `get(K paramK)` method retrieves the entry with the given key from the map.
5. The `putIfAbsent(K paramK, V paramV)` method puts the entry into the map if it does not already exist.
6. The `remove(K paramK)` method removes the entry with the given key from the map.
7. It overrides the `remove()` method from the parent class to remove the entry from both the map and the parent.
