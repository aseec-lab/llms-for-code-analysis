The `Http2Writer` class is responsible for writing data frames, headers, and other types of frames in the HTTP/2 protocol. It implements the `Closeable` interface and provides methods for writing data, flushing the underlying sink, writing frame headers, and sending a GOAWAY frame. It uses a `BufferedSink` to write the data and maintains a `maxFrameSize` value to limit the size of the frames being written.This code implements the `rstStream` method of the `Http2Writer` class. This method is used to write a RST_STREAM frame to the underlying sink. The RST_STREAM frame indicates that the sender wants to reset the specified stream with the given error code. The method checks if the writer is closed and throws an `IOException` if it is. Then, it writes the frame header, including the stream identifier and frame type. Finally, it writes the error code to the sink and flushes it.The code implements the `settings` method of the `Http2Writer` class. This method is used to write a SETTINGS frame to the underlying sink. The SETTINGS frame contains configuration parameters that modify the behavior of the HTTP/2 connection. 

The method checks if the writer is closed and throws an `IOException` if it is. Then, it writes the frame header, including the stream identifier and frame type. It iterates over the settings and writes each setting ID and value to the sink. Finally, it flushes the sink.
