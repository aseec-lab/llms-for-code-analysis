The code defines the `OkHostnameVerifier` class within the `okhttp3.internal.tls` package.

- The class implements the `HostnameVerifier` interface, which is used to verify that the hostname matches the names on an X.509 certificate.
- The class provides a method `verifyHostname` to check if a host name matches a specific name in the certificate's subject alternative names.
- The class also provides a method `verifyIpAddress` to check if an IP address matches a specific IP address in the certificate's subject alternative names.
- The `verify` methods determine whether to use `verifyIpAddress` or `verifyHostname` based on whether the input string is an IP address.
- The class also includes utility methods for retrieving all subject alternative names from a certificate.
- The class follows the Singleton pattern, with a public `INSTANCE` constant representing the sole instance of the class.
