The `FieldNamingStrategy` interface is part of the Gson library. It defines a single method:

1. `String translateName(Field paramField)`: This method is used to translate a field name into a different representation. It takes a `Field` parameter and returns a `String` representing the translated field name.

The code does not contain any implementation of this method, as it is an interface. The code also includes comments about the location and version of the Java compiler.
