The `CircularArray` class is an implementation of a circular array data structure. It provides methods for adding elements to the array, retrieving elements, and removing elements.

The class uses an array (`mElements`) to store the elements, and it maintains two indices (`mHead` and `mTail`) to keep track of the start and end of the circular array.

The `addFirst()` method adds an element to the beginning of the array. If the array is full, it doubles its capacity by creating a new array with twice the size and copying the elements.

The `addLast()` method adds an element to the end of the array. If the array is full, it doubles its capacity in the same way as `addFirst()`.

The `get()` method retrieves the element at a given index in the array.

The `getFirst()` and `getLast()` methods return the first and last elements of the array, respectively.

The `isEmpty()` method checks if the array is empty.

The `popFirst()` method removes and returns the first element of the array.

The `popLast()` method removes and returns the last element of the array.

The `removeFromEnd()` method removes elements from the end of the array.

The `removeFromStart()` method removes elements from the start of the array.

The `size()` method returns the number of elements in the array.
