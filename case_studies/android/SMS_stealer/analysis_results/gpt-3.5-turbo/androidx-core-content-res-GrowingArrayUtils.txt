The code defines a utility class named `GrowingArrayUtils` in the `androidx.core.content.res` package.

The class provides static methods for appending elements to and inserting elements into growing arrays of different types (`int`, `long`, `boolean`, and generic type `T`).

The `append()` methods are used to append an element to the array. If the array size is not sufficient to accommodate the new element, a new array with a larger size is created, and the contents of the original array are copied to the new array.

The `insert()` methods are used to insert an element at a specific index in the array. Similar to the `append()` methods, if the array size is not sufficient, a new array with a larger size is created, and the contents of the original array are copied to the new array, with an additional element inserted at the specified index.

The `growSize()` method is called internally to calculate the new size of the array when it needs to be resized. If the current size is less than or equal to 4, the new size is set to 8. Otherwise, the new size is set to double the current size.

Overall, the `GrowingArrayUtils` class provides utility methods for dynamically growing arrays of different types and inserting elements into specific positions.
