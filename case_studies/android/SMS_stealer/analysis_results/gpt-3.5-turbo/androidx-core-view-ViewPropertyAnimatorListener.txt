The code defines the interface `ViewPropertyAnimatorListener` in the `androidx.core.view` package.
This interface provides three methods: `onAnimationCancel()`, `onAnimationEnd()`, and `onAnimationStart()`. These methods are called when a View's property animation is canceled, ends, or starts respectively. The `View` parameter represents the View on which the animation is performed.
