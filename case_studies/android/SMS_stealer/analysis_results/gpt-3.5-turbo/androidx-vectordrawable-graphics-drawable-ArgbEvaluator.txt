The `ArgbEvaluator` class in the `androidx.vectordrawable.graphics.drawable` package implements the `TypeEvaluator` interface. 

The class provides a method called `evaluate` that takes three parameters - a float value, and two `Object` values. It performs color interpolation between the two given color values based on the provided float value.

The implementation converts the color values to their corresponding red, green, blue, and alpha components. It then applies gamma correction to these components using the formula `Math.pow(component, 2.2)`.

Next, it interpolates each component based on the provided float value, and applies gamma correction again using the formula `Math.pow(interpolatedComponent, 0.45454545454545453)`.

Finally, it combines the interpolated components into a single color value and returns it as an `Integer` object.

Overall, the `ArgbEvaluator` class provides a convenient way to perform color interpolation in animations.
