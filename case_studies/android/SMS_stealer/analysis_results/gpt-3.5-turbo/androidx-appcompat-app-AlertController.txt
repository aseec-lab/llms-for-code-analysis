The `setupButtons` method sets up the positive, negative, and neutral buttons of the dialog. It determines the visibility and properties of the buttons based on the customization options.

The `setupContent` method sets up the content view of the dialog, including the message and the scrollable nested scroll view. If a message is provided, it is displayed in the text view.

The `getButton` method retrieves a reference to the specified button of the dialog based on its identifier.

The `getIconAttributeResId` method retrieves the resource ID of the specified icon attribute.

The `getListView` method retrieves a reference to the list view used in the dialog.
