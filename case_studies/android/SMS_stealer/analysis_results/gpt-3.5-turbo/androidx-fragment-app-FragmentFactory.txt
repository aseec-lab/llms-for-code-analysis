The code defines the `FragmentFactory` class, which is responsible for instantiating fragments. It maintains a map of fragment class names to their corresponding classes. It provides methods to check if a given class name belongs to a fragment, load a fragment class, and instantiate a fragment using its class name and class loader. If any errors occur during instantiation, it throws a `Fragment.InstantiationException` with an appropriate error message.
