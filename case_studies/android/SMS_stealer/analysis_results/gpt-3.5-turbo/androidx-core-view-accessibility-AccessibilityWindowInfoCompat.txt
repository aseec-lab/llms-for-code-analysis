The code in `AccessibilityWindowInfoCompat.java` provides compatibility for working with AccessibilityWindowInfo, which represents information about a window displayed on the screen for accessibility purposes.

The class defines constants for different window types (e.g., application, input method) and a private variable `mInfo` to hold the actual AccessibilityWindowInfo object.

The class provides static methods to obtain instances of AccessibilityWindowInfoCompat, wrap non-null objects, and convert window types to strings.

It also provides methods to access various properties of the window, such as the anchor, bounds, children, parent, root, title, and type.

The class overrides `equals()`, `hashCode()`, `toString()`, and `recycle()` methods for proper comparison, hashing, string representation, and recycling of the AccessibilityWindowInfo object.

Overall, this code ensures compatibility with different Android versions when working with accessibility window information.
