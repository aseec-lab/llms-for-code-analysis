The code defines an interface called `ConnectionQualityChangeListener`, which is a part of the `com.androidnetworking.interfaces` package.

This interface declares one method:
1. `onChange(ConnectionQuality paramConnectionQuality, int paramInt)`: This method is called when the connection quality changes. It takes two parameters: `paramConnectionQuality`, which represents the new connection quality, and `paramInt`, which represents an additional parameter related to the connection quality change.

The purpose of this interface is to provide a mechanism for listening to connection quality changes and performing actions based on the new connection quality.
