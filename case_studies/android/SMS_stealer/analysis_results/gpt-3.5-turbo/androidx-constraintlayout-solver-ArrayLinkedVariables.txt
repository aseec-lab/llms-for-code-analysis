The `ArrayLinkedVariables` class is part of the ConstraintLayout solver in the androidx.constraintlayout.solver package. It represents a collection of variables and their coefficients in a linear equation. The class provides methods for adding variables with coefficients, dividing the coefficients by a specified amount, getting the value of a variable, checking if a variable exists, and getting the current size and head index of the variables. It also has a method for getting the pivot candidate variable for performing pivoting operations in the constraint solver. The class internally stores the variables and coefficients in arrays and supports dynamic resizing.The remaining part of the code includes methods for getting the value of a variable, getting a variable object, getting the variable value, checking if there is at least one positive variable, finding the index of a variable, inverting the variable values, adding a variable with a coefficient, removing a variable, calculating the size in bytes, and converting the variables to a string representation. There is also a method for performing pivoting operations by using the variables from another constraint row.
