The code defines an interface called `ViewModelStoreOwner` in the `androidx.lifecycle` package.

This interface has a single method called `getViewModelStore`, which returns a `ViewModelStore`. 

The `ViewModelStoreOwner` interface is typically implemented by classes that own a `ViewModelStore`, which is used to hold and manage instances of `ViewModel` objects. The `ViewModelStore` is responsible for retaining `ViewModel` objects across configuration changes, such as screen rotations, so that the data is not lost.
