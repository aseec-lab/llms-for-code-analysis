The `ConstraintAttribute` class is responsible for representing and managing attributes of a constraint in a `ConstraintLayout`. It stores information such as the attribute name, type, and value. It provides methods for extracting attributes from a view, parsing XML attributes, setting attributes on a view, and determining if two attributes are different. It also provides a method to get the type of the attribute and a method to get the value of the attribute for interpolation.The `ConstraintAttribute` class represents and manages attributes of a constraint in a ConstraintLayout.
