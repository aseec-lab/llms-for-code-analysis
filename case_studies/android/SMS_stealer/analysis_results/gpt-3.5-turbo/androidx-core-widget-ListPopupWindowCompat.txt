The `ListPopupWindowCompat` class in the `androidx.core.widget` package provides compatibility methods for working with `ListPopupWindow` across different versions of Android.

The class includes the following methods:

- `createDragToOpenListener(ListPopupWindow paramListPopupWindow, View paramView)`: Creates a drag-to-open listener for a `ListPopupWindow`, returning an `OnTouchListener` that can be set on a view. The method checks the device's SDK version and calls the appropriate method based on the version.
- `createDragToOpenListener(Object paramObject, View paramView)`: Deprecated method that calls the `createDragToOpenListener(ListPopupWindow paramListPopupWindow, View paramView)` method, casting the `paramObject` to a `ListPopupWindow`.

The purpose of these methods is to provide a consistent way to create drag-to-open listeners for `ListPopupWindow` objects across different versions of Android.
