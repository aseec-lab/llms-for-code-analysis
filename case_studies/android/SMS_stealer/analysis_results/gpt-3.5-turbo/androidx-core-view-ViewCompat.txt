The `ViewCompat` class in the `androidx.core.view` package provides compatibility methods for working with views. This code initializes constants, fields, and methods used by the `ViewCompat` class.This code continues to define various methods for working with views in a backward-compatible manner. Some of these methods include dispatching window insets, dispatching nested scrolls, dispatching temporary detach events, enabling accessible clickable spans, generating view IDs, getting accessibility delegates, getting accessibility live regions, getting accessibility node providers, getting background tint list and mode, getting clip bounds, getting display, getting elevation, getting fits system windows, getting important for accessibility, getting important for autofill, getting label for, getting layout direction, getting the matrix, getting measured height and state, getting measured width and state, getting minimum height, getting minimum width, getting outline, getting padding end, getting padding start, getting pane title for accessibility, getting transition name, getting translation x and y, getting width and height, and more.This code defines a set of helper methods for working with views in a backward-compatible manner. It includes methods for getting and setting various properties of a view, such as minimum height, minimum width, padding, translation, rotation, scale, and more. It also includes methods for checking if a view has an accessibility delegate, if it has over-scroll mode, if it has nested scrolling parent, if it has explicit focusability, and more. Additionally, it includes methods for handling view accessibility, layout, and scrolling behavior.This code includes various helper methods for working with views in an Android application. It provides compatibility for different versions of Android, including methods for getting and setting view properties, handling accessibility, layout, and scrolling behavior, and performing various actions on views.This code contains various helper methods for working with views in an Android application. These methods include setting background tint mode, enabling/disabling children drawing order, setting clip bounds, elevation, important for accessibility, autofill, and keyboard navigation cluster. It also includes methods for setting labels, layer paint, layout direction, nested scrolling, and transition names. Additionally, it provides methods for drag and drop, starting/stopping nested scrolling, and setting system gesture exclusion rects.The code provides an UnhandledKeyEventManager class that manages unhandled key events for views. It keeps track of views that have registered listeners for unhandled key events and dispatches the events to the appropriate listeners.
The class maintains a list of weak references to views with listeners and a map of captured keys. It provides methods to register and unregister listening views, dispatch key events in order, and handle unhandled key events.The code contains the remaining part of the UnhandledKeyEventManager class in the androidx.core.view.ViewCompat file. It includes methods to unregister listening views, dispatch key events in order, and handle unhandled key events. The dispatch() method dispatches a key event to the appropriate listener and updates the map of captured keys. The preDispatch() method checks if a key event has already been dispatched and handles unhandled key events that were captured.
