The `IResultReceiver` interface is part of the "android.support.v4.os" package. It extends the `IInterface` interface and defines a method called `send` that takes an integer and a Bundle as parameters and throws a `RemoteException`.

The `IResultReceiver` interface also contains a `Default` nested class that implements the `IResultReceiver` interface and provides a default implementation for the `send` method. 

The `Stub` nested class is an abstract class that extends the `Binder` class and implements the `IResultReceiver` interface. It provides an implementation for the `asBinder` method and defines a constant for the transaction code used in the `onTransact` method.

The `Stub` class also contains a `Proxy` nested class that implements the `IResultReceiver` interface. It has a constructor that takes an `IBinder` parameter and implements the methods from the `IResultReceiver` interface. The `send` method implementation creates a `Parcel` object, writes the interface token and the integer parameter, and then writes the Bundle if it is not null. It then calls the `transact` method on the remote `IBinder`. If the transaction is not successful, it checks if there is a default implementation available and invokes the `send` method on it. Finally, it recycles the `Parcel` object.

Overall, the `IResultReceiver` interface and its related classes provide a way to send results between components using Bundles and remote method calls.
