The `PriorityGoalRow` class is a subclass of `ArrayRow` and represents a row in a linear programming problem where the goal is to minimize or maximize a specific variable. It manages a list of solver variables and their corresponding goal strengths.

The class contains methods for adding and removing solver variables from the goal row, updating the goal row from another row, and finding the pivot candidate for the next iteration of the solver algorithm.

The `GoalVariableAccessor` inner class is used to access and manipulate the goal strengths of a solver variable in the goal row.The `compare` method compares the strengths of two `GoalVariableAccessor` objects based on their goal strengths.

The `reset` method sets all goal strengths of the `variable` in the `GoalVariableAccessor` object to zero.

The `toString` method returns a string representation of the `GoalVariableAccessor` object, including the goal strengths and the variable.
