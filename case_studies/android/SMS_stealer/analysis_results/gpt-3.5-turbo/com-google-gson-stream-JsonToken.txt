The `JsonToken` enum class defines different types of JSON tokens. Each enum constant represents a specific token type.

Here's what the code does:

- It defines enum constants for different JSON token types, such as `BEGIN_ARRAY`, `BEGIN_OBJECT`, `BOOLEAN`, `END_ARRAY`, etc.

- It declares a static array field `$VALUES` to store all the enum constants.

- In the static block, it initializes the enum constants by creating new instances of `JsonToken` with their respective names and ordinal values.

- The commented section at the end of the file includes information about the location and version of the Java compiler used to compile the code.
