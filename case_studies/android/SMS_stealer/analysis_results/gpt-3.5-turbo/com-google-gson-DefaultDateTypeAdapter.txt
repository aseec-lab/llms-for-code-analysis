The `DefaultDateTypeAdapter` class is a subclass of `TypeAdapter` and is used by Gson to serialize and deserialize `Date` objects in JSON format.

The class provides several constructors that allow customization of the date format, such as specifying the date and time format, or just the date format.

The `read` method reads a JSON value from a `JsonReader` and converts it to a `Date` object. It checks the type of the JSON value and deserializes it accordingly.

The `write` method writes a `Date` object to a `JsonWriter` in JSON format. It formats the `Date` using the `enUsFormat` and writes it as a string value.

The class also overrides the `toString` method to provide a string representation of the `DefaultDateTypeAdapter` object.
