The `Address` class in the `okhttp3` package represents the address of a network resource such as a URL. It contains various properties related to the address, including the URL itself, DNS resolver, socket factory, SSL socket factory, proxy, proxy authenticator, protocols, connection spec, proxy selector, hostname verifier, and certificate pinner. 

The `Address` class provides methods to access and modify these properties, such as getting the certificate pinner, connection specs, DNS resolver, hostname verifier, protocols, socket factory, SSL socket factory, proxy, proxy authenticator, and proxy selector. It also has methods to check equality and calculate the hash code. Additionally, it has a `toString` method to represent the address as a string.
