The `FragmentManagerViewModel` class is a subclass of `ViewModel` in the `androidx.fragment.app` package. It is responsible for managing retained fragments and their non-configuration state.

This class keeps track of retained fragments, child non-configurations, and `ViewModelStores`. It provides methods for adding and removing retained fragments, clearing non-configuration state, getting child non-configurations and `ViewModelStores`, and restoring from a snapshot.

The class overrides the `equals`, `hashCode`, `onCleared`, and `toString` methods from the `ViewModel` superclass.
