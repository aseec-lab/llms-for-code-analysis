The `ActionBarBackgroundDrawable` class is a `Drawable` that is used as the background for the action bar in the Android AppCompat support library.

The class has a constructor that takes an `ActionBarContainer` parameter. It sets the `mContainer` variable of type `ActionBarContainer` to the provided parameter.

The `draw` method is overridden from the `Drawable` class. If the action bar container is split, it draws the split background if it exists. Otherwise, it draws the main background and the stacked background if they exist and the action bar is stacked.

The `getOpacity` method returns the opacity of the drawable, which is always 0.

The `getOutline` method is overridden from the `Drawable` class. If the action bar container is split, it retrieves the outline from the split background if it exists. Otherwise, it retrieves the outline from the main background.

The `setAlpha` method is empty and does nothing.

The `setColorFilter` method is empty and does nothing.
