The code defines the `RestrictTo` annotation in the `androidx.annotation` package. This annotation is used to indicate that a class, method, field, or package is restricted to a specific scope.

The `RestrictTo` annotation can be applied to annotations, classes, methods, constructors, fields, and packages using the `@Target` annotation.

The `RestrictTo` annotation has an array of `Scope` elements as its value. The `Scope` enum represents different scopes that can be used to restrict the access.

The available `Scope` values are `GROUP_ID`, `LIBRARY`, `LIBRARY_GROUP`, `LIBRARY_GROUP_PREFIX`, `SUBCLASSES`, and `TESTS`.

The `RestrictTo` annotation has a retention policy of `RetentionPolicy.CLASS`, meaning it is stored in the compiled bytecode but not available at runtime.

The code does not contain any functional logic. It only defines the `RestrictTo` annotation and its associated target elements and enum values.
