The `ObjectConstructor` interface in the `com.google.gson.internal` package is a generic interface that declares a single method `construct()`. The purpose of this interface is to provide a contract for constructing objects of type `T`. The `construct()` method is expected to create and return an instance of the specified object type.

This interface does not provide any implementation details. Its sole purpose is to define a common interface for classes that can construct objects.
