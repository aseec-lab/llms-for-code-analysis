The `ContainerHelpers` class is part of the `androidx.collection` package and is located in the `ContainerHelpers.java` file. 

This class provides various helper methods for working with container data structures, such as arrays.

The class defines three empty arrays of different types: `EMPTY_INTS`, `EMPTY_LONGS`, and `EMPTY_OBJECTS`. These arrays are used to represent empty arrays of their respective types.

The class provides two binary search methods, `binarySearch(int[] paramArrayOfint, int paramInt1, int paramInt2)` and `binarySearch(long[] paramArrayOflong, int paramInt, long paramLong)`. These methods perform binary search on a given array of integers or longs and return the index of the target value if found, otherwise returns a negative value.

The class also provides a method `equal(Object paramObject1, Object paramObject2)` that checks if two objects are equal. It returns true if the objects are the same or if `paramObject1` is not null and is equal to `paramObject2` according to `equals()` method.

Additionally, the class includes three methods `idealByteArraySize(int paramInt)`, `idealIntArraySize(int paramInt)`, and `idealLongArraySize(int paramInt)`. These methods calculate the ideal size for a byte array, int array, or long array respectively based on the given input size. The calculated ideal size is the next power of two minus a fixed amount to account for object header size.
