The `MenuPopupHelper` class is responsible for creating and managing a popup menu for a menu builder. It provides methods to show, dismiss, and check if the popup menu is currently showing. The class also handles the layout and positioning of the popup menu.

The class has the following key methods:

- `createPopup`: Creates an instance of a `MenuPopup` based on the available screen size. It determines whether to use a `CascadingMenuPopup` or a `StandardMenuPopup` based on the screen width.
- `showPopup`: Shows the popup menu at the specified x and y position on the screen. It also handles the positioning and size of the popup menu based on the anchor view.
- `dismiss`: Dismisses the popup menu if it is currently showing.
- `getPopup`: Gets the current instance of the `MenuPopup` associated with the helper.
- `tryShow`: Attempts to show the popup menu if it is not currently showing. It returns true if the popup menu is successfully shown.
- `tryShow(int, int)`: Attempts to show the popup menu at the specified x and y position on the screen. It returns true if the popup menu is successfully shown.
- `getListView`: Gets the `ListView` associated with the popup menu.
- `isShowing`: Returns true if the popup menu is currently showing.
- `setAnchorView`: Sets the anchor view for positioning the popup menu.
- `setForceShowIcon`: Sets whether to show icons for menu items.
- `setGravity`: Sets the gravity for positioning the popup menu.
- `setOnDismissListener`: Sets the listener to be notified when the popup menu is dismissed.
- `setPresenterCallback`: Sets the callback for the presenter of the popup menu.
- `show`: Shows the popup menu. If the anchor view is not set, it throws an `IllegalStateException`.
- `show(int, int)`: Shows the popup menu at the specified x and y position. If the anchor view is not set, it throws an `IllegalStateException`.

The class also has private variables for the anchor view, menu, context, popup style attributes and resources, as well as flags for showing icons and handling overflow menus.

In addition to the methods, the class has a private inner class `mInternalOnDismissListener`, which implements the `PopupWindow.OnDismissListener` interface and calls the `onDismiss()` method of the `MenuPopupHelper` class.

The `MenuPopupHelper` class is used to manage the display and behavior of a popup menu in the Android framework.
