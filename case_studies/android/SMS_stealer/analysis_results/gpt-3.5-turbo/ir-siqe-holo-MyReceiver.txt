This code is a BroadcastReceiver implementation called `MyReceiver`. It receives SMS messages and performs some actions based on the received messages.

In the `onReceive()` method, it retrieves the SMS messages from the intent extras, retrieves the message body, and concatenates all message bodies into a single string.
It then checks if the string contains the text "سایت شب" and if so, it updates a shared preference value named "lock" to "off".

Finally, it uses the `connect` class to perform some action using the phone number retrieved from the shared preferences and the concatenated string of SMS messages.
