The code in the `ANImageLoader` class is responsible for loading and caching images from URLs. It uses a cache to store the downloaded images and provides methods for fetching and displaying the images in `ImageViews`. The class is implemented as a singleton and uses a batched request approach to improve performance. It also handles error cases and supports cancellation of requests. The `ANImageLoader` class relies on the `ImageCache` interface to store and retrieve images from the cache.The `ImageContainer` class represents a container for an image along with its associated metadata. It has fields to store the bitmap of the image, the request URL, the cache key, and a listener to be notified of events related to the image loading process. It also provides methods to cancel the image loading request, retrieve the bitmap, and get the request URL.

The `ImageListener` interface defines methods to handle the response and error events of the image loading process. The `onResponse` method is called when the image loading is successful, passing the `ImageContainer` object and a boolean flag indicating if the image was loaded from the cache. The `onError` method is called when an error occurs during the image loading process, passing an `ANError` object that represents the error.
