The `SubMenuWrapperICS` class is a subclass of `MenuWrapperICS` and implements the `SubMenu` interface. It serves as a wrapper for the support sub-menu in an Android application.

The class provides methods for interacting with the sub-menu, such as `clearHeader()` to clear the header of the sub-menu, `getItem()` to get the menu item associated with the sub-menu, and methods for setting the header icon, title, view, and icon of the sub-menu.

It relies on the support sub-menu implementation from the AndroidX library and delegates most of its functionality to the underlying support sub-menu.

The class is part of the `androidx.appcompat.view.menu` package and is located in the `androidx.appcompat.view.menu.SubMenuWrapperICS` file.
