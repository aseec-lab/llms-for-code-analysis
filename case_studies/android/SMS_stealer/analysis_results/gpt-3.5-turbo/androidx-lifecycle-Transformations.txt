The `Transformations` class in the `androidx.lifecycle` package provides static methods for transforming LiveData objects.

- The `map()` method takes a source LiveData object and a `mapFunction` function that transforms the value of the source LiveData. It creates a new `MediatorLiveData` object, adds the source LiveData as a source, and updates the new LiveData with the transformed value whenever the source LiveData changes. The transformed LiveData is then returned.

- The `switchMap()` method is similar to the `map()` method, but it takes a `switchMapFunction` function that returns a new LiveData object based on the value of the source LiveData. Whenever the source LiveData changes, the `switchMapFunction` is called to get the new LiveData, and the old LiveData source is removed and replaced with the new LiveData source. The transformed LiveData is then returned.

Both methods use `MediatorLiveData` internally to observe changes in the source LiveData and propagate updates to the transformed LiveData.

These methods facilitate the transformation of LiveData objects and make it easy to create new LiveData objects based on existing ones.
