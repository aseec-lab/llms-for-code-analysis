The code defines a class called BuildCompat in the package androidx.core.os. 

The class provides several static methods that check the Android version compatibility. 

- The isAtLeastN method checks if the Android version is at least N (SDK version 24). 
- The isAtLeastNMR1 method checks if the Android version is at least NMR1 (SDK version 25). 
- The isAtLeastO method checks if the Android version is at least O (SDK version 26). 
- The isAtLeastOMR1 method checks if the Android version is at least OMR1 (SDK version 27). 
- The isAtLeastP method checks if the Android version is at least P (SDK version 28). 
- The isAtLeastQ method checks if the Android version is at least Q (SDK version 29). 
- The isAtLeastR method checks if the Android version is at least R. It does this by checking the length of the CODENAME and comparing the first character to 'R'. 

The class and all the methods are marked with the @Deprecated annotation, indicating that they are no longer recommended to be used. 

The code also includes a comment with the file path, Java compiler version, and JD-Core version.
