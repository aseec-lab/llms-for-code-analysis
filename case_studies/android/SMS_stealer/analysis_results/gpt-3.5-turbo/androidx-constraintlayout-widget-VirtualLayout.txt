The `VirtualLayout` class is a subclass of `ConstraintHelper` in the `androidx.constraintlayout.widget` package. It represents a virtual layout that provides utility methods for manipulating constraints.

The class has three constructors, where each constructor calls the corresponding constructor of the superclass.

The `init` method initializes the `mApplyVisibilityOnAttach` and `mApplyElevationOnAttach` fields based on the attributes obtained from the `paramAttributeSet`.

The `onAttachedToWindow` method sets the visibility and elevation of the child views based on the values of `mApplyVisibilityOnAttach` and `mApplyElevationOnAttach`.

The `onMeasure` method is empty.

The `setElevation` method calls the superclass method and applies layout features.

The `setVisibility` method calls the superclass method and applies layout features.
