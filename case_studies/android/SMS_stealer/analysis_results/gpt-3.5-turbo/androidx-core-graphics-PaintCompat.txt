The `PaintCompat` class in the `androidx.core.graphics` package provides compatibility methods for working with `Paint` objects.

Here's a brief summary of what the code does:

- The `hasGlyph()` method checks if a given `Paint` object can render a specified string. It uses different techniques depending on the Android API level, including measuring text widths, checking if the string contains whitespace, and comparing text bounds.

- The `obtainEmptyRects()` method retrieves a pair of empty `Rect` objects from a `ThreadLocal` variable, creating them if necessary.

- The `setBlendMode()` method sets the blend mode of a `Paint` object. It uses different techniques depending on the Android API level, including using the `setBlendMode()` method or setting an `Xfermode` with a `PorterDuff.Mode`.
