The `NavItemSelectedListener` class is a class that implements the `AdapterView.OnItemSelectedListener` interface. It is used in the `ActionBar` to handle item selection events in a navigation dropdown list.

The class has a constructor that takes an `ActionBar.OnNavigationListener` parameter and assigns it to the `mListener` variable. 

The `onItemSelected` method is implemented to call the `onNavigationItemSelected` method of the `mListener` if it is not null.

The `onNothingSelected` method is implemented but left empty.
