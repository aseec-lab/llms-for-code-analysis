The code in the "com/androidnetworking/utils/ParseUtil.java" file is a utility class in the AndroidNetworking library that provides a way to get and set the Parser.Factory object used for parsing network responses.

Here is a brief description of what the code does:

- The class has a private static Parser.Factory object named mParserFactory, which holds the current Parser.Factory instance.
- The class provides a static method "getParserFactory()" that returns the current Parser.Factory object. If the mParserFactory is null, it initializes it with a new instance of GsonParserFactory, which uses the Gson library for parsing.
- The class also provides a static method "setParserFactory()" that allows users to set a custom Parser.Factory object.
- Lastly, there is a static method "shutDown()" that sets the mParserFactory to null, effectively shutting down the parsing functionality.

In summary, this utility class in the AndroidNetworking library manages the Parser.Factory object used for parsing network responses and provides methods to get, set, and shut down the Parser.Factory functionality.
