The code defines a `Progress` class in the `com.androidnetworking.model` package. This class implements the `Serializable` interface.

The `Progress` class has two public fields: `currentBytes` and `totalBytes`. These fields represent the current and total number of bytes in a process.

The class has a constructor that takes two parameters: `paramLong1` and `paramLong2`. These parameters are used to initialize the `currentBytes` and `totalBytes` fields, respectively.
