The `Connection.java` file in the `okhttp3` package defines the `Connection` interface. 

The `Connection` interface declares several methods:

1. The `handshake` method returns a `Handshake` object or null. The `Handshake` interface represents the handshake between the client and server during the initial connection setup.

2. The `protocol` method returns a `Protocol` object. The `Protocol` enum represents the communication protocol used by the connection.

3. The `route` method returns a `Route` object. The `Route` class represents the route that the connection is using, including the proxy server if applicable.

4. The `socket` method returns a `Socket` object. The `Socket` class represents a socket connection that can be used for reading and writing data.

This interface provides a way to interact with a connection established by OkHttp.
