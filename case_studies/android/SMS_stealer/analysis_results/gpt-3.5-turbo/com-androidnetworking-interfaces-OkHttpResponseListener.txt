The code defines an interface called `OkHttpResponseListener`, which is a part of the `com.androidnetworking.interfaces` package.

This interface has two methods: 
1. `onError`, which takes in an `ANError` parameter and is responsible for handling errors that occur during an HTTP response.
2. `onResponse`, which takes in a `Response` parameter and is responsible for handling a successful HTTP response.

Overall, the `OkHttpResponseListener` interface provides a mechanism for handling HTTP responses, both successful and errors, in the Android Networking library.
