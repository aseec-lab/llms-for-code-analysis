The `AnimatedVectorDrawableCompat` class is a subclass of `VectorDrawableCommon` and implements the `Animatable2Compat` interface. It represents a vector drawable with animation support that is compatible with older versions of Android.

The class provides methods for creating, inflating, and drawing animated vector drawables. It also allows registering and unregistering animation callbacks, applying themes, getting and setting properties such as alpha and color filter, and getting intrinsic dimensions and opacity.

The class uses an `AnimatedVectorDrawableCompatState` object to maintain the state of the animated vector drawable, which includes the vector drawable itself, the animator set, the list of animation callbacks, and other properties.

The class also uses a `Drawable.Callback` object to handle invalidation and scheduling of drawables.

The class supports both platform-specific animated vector drawables (on Android 5.0 and above) and backward-compatible animated vector drawables created using XML files.The code implements various methods for the `AnimatedVectorDrawableCompat` class. These methods are responsible for handling various aspects of the animated vector drawable, such as its visual appearance, animation behavior, and interaction with other drawables.

Some of the key methods include `isAutoMirrored()`, `isRunning()`, `isStateful()`, `mutate()`, `setAlpha()`, `setAutoMirrored()`, `setColorFilter()`, `setTint()`, `setTintList()`, `setTintMode()`, `setVisible()`, `start()`, `stop()`, `registerAnimationCallback()`, and `unregisterAnimationCallback()`. These methods provide functionality related to the state, appearance, and behavior of the animated vector drawable.

The code also includes nested classes `AnimatedVectorDrawableCompatState` and `AnimatedVectorDrawableDelegateState`. These classes represent the state of the animated vector drawable and its delegate drawable, respectively. They are used to instantiate and manage the drawable objects.

In addition, there are methods for handling changes to the bounds, level, and state of the drawable, as well as for setting up and managing the animator set used for animation.
