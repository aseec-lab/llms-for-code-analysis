The code snippet represents the `IntRange` annotation, which is defined in the `androidx.annotation` package. 

This annotation is used to indicate that the annotated element represents an integer value within a specific range. It can be applied to methods, parameters, fields, local variables, and annotation types. 

The `IntRange` annotation has a retention policy of `RetentionPolicy.CLASS`, meaning it is retained in the compiled bytecode.

The `IntRange` annotation has two attributes: `from()` and `to()`, which define the lower and upper bounds of the range, respectively. These attributes have default values of the minimum and maximum possible long integer values.

The code also includes some comments indicating the file location, Java compiler version, and JD-Core version.
