The `ANResponse` class is used to represent the response of a network request. It contains two constructors: one that takes an `ANError` object to represent a failed response, and another that takes a generic type `T` to represent a successful response. It also provides static methods `failed()` and `success()` to create instances of `ANResponse` with the appropriate error or result.

The class has a `private final ANError` variable to store the error, a generic `T` variable to store the result, and a `Response` variable to store the OkHttp response. It provides getter and setter methods for these variables.

The `isSuccess()` method checks if the response is successful by checking if the `mANError` variable is null. If it is null, it returns true, indicating a successful response.

The `ANResponse` class is a simple wrapper for representing the response of a network request, including both successful and failed responses.
