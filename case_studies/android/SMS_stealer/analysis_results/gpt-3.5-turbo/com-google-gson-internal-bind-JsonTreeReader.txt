The `JsonTreeReader` class is a subclass of `JsonReader` that reads JSON from a `JsonElement` object. 

It maintains a stack to keep track of the current position in the JSON structure and provides methods to read different types of JSON values such as arrays, objects, booleans, numbers, strings, and null values.

The class also defines methods for checking the current token, advancing to the next token, and retrieving the path of the current position in the JSON structure.

The `JsonTreeReader` class is used internally by Gson for deserializing JSON into Java objects.The remaining code of `JsonTreeReader` class includes the following methods:

- `peek()`: Determines the type of the current JSON token.
- `promoteNameToValue()`: Promotes the current name token to a value token.
- `skipValue()`: Skips the current value token.
- `toString()`: Returns the name of the class as a string.

These methods are used internally by Gson for parsing and navigating the JSON structure.
