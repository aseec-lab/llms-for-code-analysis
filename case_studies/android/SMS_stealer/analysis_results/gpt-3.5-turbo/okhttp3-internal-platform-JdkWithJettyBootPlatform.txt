The code in the `JdkWithJettyBootPlatform` class is a platform implementation for the OkHttp library. It provides support for the Jetty ALPN (Application-Layer Protocol Negotiation) extension, which allows clients and servers to negotiate the protocol to use over a secure connection.

The class relies on reflection to interact with the Jetty ALPN classes and methods. It has methods to configure TLS extensions, handle handshakes, and retrieve the selected protocol.

The `JettyNegoProvider` class is a private inner class used as an invocation handler for the ALPN methods. It handles method invocations and maintains the selected protocol.

The `buildIfSupported` method in the class is a factory method that checks if the Jetty ALPN classes are available and creates an instance of `JdkWithJettyBootPlatform` if they are.

Overall, the code provides support for the Jetty ALPN extension in the OkHttp library on platforms that include the necessary classes and methods.
