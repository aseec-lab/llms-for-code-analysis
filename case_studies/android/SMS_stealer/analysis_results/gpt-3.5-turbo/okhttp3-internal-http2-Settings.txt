The `Settings` class is responsible for managing HTTP/2 settings. It contains a set of constant values for different settings parameters. 

The class has an array of integer values representing the settings values, with a corresponding bitset to keep track of which settings have been set. 

The class provides methods to get and set the values of different settings parameters, such as `getEnablePush()`, `getHeaderTableSize()`, `getInitialWindowSize()`, `getMaxConcurrentStreams()`, `getMaxFrameSize()`, and `getMaxHeaderListSize()`. 

It also provides methods to check if a particular setting has been set using the `isSet()` method, to clear the settings using the `clear()` method, and to merge settings from another `Settings` object using the `merge()` method.

The `set()` method allows setting the value of a particular setting parameter. The `size()` method returns the number of settings that have been set.
