The code defines a class called BasicMeasure.
It contains constants for measurement modes and behaviors.
It has a field for storing the ConstraintWidgetContainer.
It has a Measure field for performing measurements.
It has an ArrayList for storing variable dimensions widgets.
The class constructor takes a ConstraintWidgetContainer parameter and initializes the fields.
The measure method takes a Measurer, ConstraintWidget, and measure strategy as parameters and performs the measurement.
The measureChildren method measures the children of the ConstraintWidgetContainer.
The solveLinearSystem method solves the linear system to layout the ConstraintWidgetContainer.
The solverMeasure method measures the ConstraintWidgetContainer using a Measurer and various parameters, and returns a measurement duration.The code is implementing the measurement behavior for a ConstraintWidgetContainer layout. It measures the dimensions of the widgets based on their constraints and applies the necessary optimizations to layout the widgets efficiently. The code also updates the hierarchy of the widgets based on their dimension behaviors.This is the remaining part of the previous code, it includes the closing curly brace for the BasicMeasure class definition.
