The `AppCompatCheckedTextView` class is a subclass of `CheckedTextView` that provides compatibility support for older versions of Android. 

It extends `CheckedTextView` and implements various methods related to text appearance, compound drawables, and input connection.

The class has a `AppCompatTextHelper` object that helps with handling text appearance and compound drawables.

The constructors initialize the `AppCompatTextHelper` object, apply compound drawables tints, and set the check mark drawable.

The `drawableStateChanged()` method ensures that compound drawables tints are applied when the state of the view changes.

The `onCreateInputConnection()` method creates an input connection using the `AppCompatHintHelper` class.

The `setCustomSelectionActionModeCallback()` method sets a custom action mode callback for text selection.

Finally, the `setTextAppearance()` method sets the text appearance and applies any necessary updates to the `AppCompatTextHelper`.
