The `PathInterpolatorCompat` class is a utility class that implements the `Interpolator` interface. It provides an interpolation function based on a specified path. 

- The class has two arrays, `mX` and `mY`, that store the coordinates of the path points.
- The `PathInterpolatorCompat` constructor takes the necessary parameters to create the interpolator from an XML resource.
- The `initPath()` method initializes the interpolator with a `Path` object by sampling points along the path and storing their coordinates in the `mX` and `mY` arrays.
- The `getInterpolation()` method calculates the interpolated value based on the input parameter `paramFloat` and the coordinates stored in the `mX` and `mY` arrays.
