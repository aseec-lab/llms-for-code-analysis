The `NamedRunnable` class is an abstract class that implements the `Runnable` interface in the `okhttp3.internal` package.

It has a constructor that takes a `String` name and an array of `Object` arguments. The name is formatted using the `Util.format()` method and stored in the `name` field.

The class has an abstract method `execute()` that must be implemented by its subclasses.

The `run()` method sets the name of the current thread to the `name` field, executes the `execute()` method, and then restores the original name of the thread.
