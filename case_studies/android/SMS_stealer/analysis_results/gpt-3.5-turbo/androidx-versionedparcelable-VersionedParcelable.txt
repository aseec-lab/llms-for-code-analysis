The code provided defines an interface named `VersionedParcelable` within the `androidx.versionedparcelable` package.

This interface does not contain any methods or fields. It serves as a marker interface, indicating that a class implementing it is a versioned parcelable object. Versioned parcelable objects are used for data serialization and deserialization in Android projects.

The code does not have any specific functionality, as it only declares the `VersionedParcelable` interface.
