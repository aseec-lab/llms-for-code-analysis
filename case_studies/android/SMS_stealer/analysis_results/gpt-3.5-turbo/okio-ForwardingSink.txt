The `ForwardingSink` class in the `okio` package implements the `Sink` interface and provides a way to forward calls to another `Sink` instance.

The class has a constructor that takes a `Sink` instance as a parameter and sets it as the delegate. 

The class delegates the `close()`, `flush()`, `timeout()`, and `write()` methods to the delegate `Sink` instance. 

The class also overrides the `toString()` method to provide a string representation of the class name and the delegate `Sink` instance.
