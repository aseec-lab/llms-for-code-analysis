The `SelfDestructiveThread` class in the `androidx.core.provider` package provides a way to execute tasks on a separate thread that can automatically be destroyed after a certain period of inactivity. It uses a `HandlerThread` to run the tasks and a `Handler` to handle the tasks. Tasks can be posted to the thread using the `post()` method, and there are methods to check if the thread is currently running and to get the generation number of the thread. The class also provides methods to post a task and receive a reply, as well as to post a task and wait for its result with a timeout.
