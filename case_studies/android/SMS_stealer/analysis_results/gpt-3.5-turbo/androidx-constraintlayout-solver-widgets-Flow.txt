The code defines constants for different alignment options.
The code declares several instance variables that are used to manage alignment and layout properties.
The createAlignedConstraints() method creates constraints for aligned elements based on the specified alignment options.
The getWidgetHeight() method calculates the height of a widget based on its constraints and dimension behavior.
The getWidgetWidth() method calculates the width of a widget based on its constraints and dimension behavior.
The measureAligned() method measures the aligned widgets to determine their size and position.This part of the code calculates the width and height of aligned elements based on their constraints and dimension behavior.
It also determines the biggest elements in each row and column and stores them in arrays.
Finally, it measures the width and height of the aligned elements and stores them in an array for further use.The code copies the properties of a Flow widget, such as the style, bias, and gaps, from another Flow widget. It uses a HashMap to keep track of the copied widgets.- The code re-computes the dimensions of a Flow widget based on its contained widgets.
- It calculates the width and height of the widget by considering the sizes of the contained widgets and the gaps between them.
- It keeps track of the biggest widget, both in terms of width and height.
- It also counts the number of widgets with a MATCH_CONSTRAINT dimension behavior.
- The code has methods to set various properties of the Flow widget, such as alignment, bias, gap size, and wrap mode.
- It uses a WidgetsList class to manage the list of contained widgets and calculate their dimensions.##########
