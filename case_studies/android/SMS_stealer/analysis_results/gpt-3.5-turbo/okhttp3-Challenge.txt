The `Challenge.java` file in the `okhttp3` package defines the `Challenge` class, which represents an authentication challenge from an HTTP server.

Here is a summary of the code:

- The class has private fields for the character set, realm, and scheme of the challenge.
- The constructor initializes the fields with the given values, throwing `NullPointerException` if any of the parameters are `null`.
- The class provides getter methods for the character set, realm, and scheme.
- The class overrides the `equals()` and `hashCode()` methods to compare `Challenge` objects based on their scheme, realm, and character set.
- The `toString()` method returns a string representation of the challenge, including the scheme, realm, and character set.
- The `withCharset()` method creates a new `Challenge` object with the given character set, while keeping the same scheme and realm.
