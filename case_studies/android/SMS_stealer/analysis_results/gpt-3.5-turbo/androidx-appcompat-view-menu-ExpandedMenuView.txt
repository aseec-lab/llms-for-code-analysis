The `ExpandedMenuView` class is a subclass of `ListView` and implements the `MenuBuilder.ItemInvoker`, `MenuView`, and `AdapterView.OnItemClickListener` interfaces. It serves as a custom view for displaying an expanded menu in an Android application.

The class provides methods for initializing the menu, setting the window animations, and invoking menu item actions. It also handles the onItemClick event to invoke the corresponding menu item action.

The class uses a `TintTypedArray` to obtain styled attributes for the background drawable and divider, and sets them accordingly.

The class is part of the `androidx.appcompat.view.menu` package and is located in the `androidx.appcompat.view.menu.ExpandedMenuView` file.
