The `SavedStateRegistryOwner` interface defines the contract for an object that owns a `SavedStateRegistry` and implements the `LifecycleOwner` interface.

The `SavedStateRegistryOwner` interface has one method: `getSavedStateRegistry()`, which returns the `SavedStateRegistry` owned by the object.

The `SavedStateRegistry` is responsible for saving and restoring the state of an object across configuration changes, such as screen rotations. It allows an object to save its state before being destroyed and restore that state when recreated.

This interface is part of the `androidx.savedstate` package, and the code is located in the `SavedStateRegistryOwner.java` file.
