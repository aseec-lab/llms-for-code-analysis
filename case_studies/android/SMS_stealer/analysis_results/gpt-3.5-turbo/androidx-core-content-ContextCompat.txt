The `ContextCompat` class in the `androidx.core.content` package provides compatibility methods for accessing various system services and resources in Android.

Key features of the `ContextCompat` class include:

- Compatibility methods for checking and requesting permissions.
- Compatibility methods for creating device protected storage context.
- Compatibility methods for accessing code cache directory.
- Compatibility methods for retrieving colors and color state lists.
- Compatibility methods for accessing data directory.
- Compatibility methods for retrieving drawable resources.
- Compatibility methods for accessing external cache and files directories.
- Compatibility methods for retrieving the main executor.
- Compatibility methods for accessing no backup files directory.
- Compatibility methods for accessing obb directories.
- Compatibility methods for retrieving system services by name or class.
- Compatibility methods for checking if the app's data is stored in protected storage.
- Compatibility methods for starting activities and services, including foreground services.
- Compatibility method for starting activities with multiple intents.
- Compatibility method for starting activities with intents and bundles.The remaining part of the code defines a `SERVICES` map that maps certain system service classes to their corresponding service name. It includes services such as `LocationManager`, `NfcManager`, `NotificationManager`, `PowerManager`, and more.

The code also defines a `MainHandlerExecutor` class that implements the `Executor` interface. It takes a `Handler` object in its constructor and uses it to execute the given `Runnable` object on the main thread. If the `Handler` is shutting down, a `RejectedExecutionException` is thrown.

This part of the code completes the implementation of the `ContextCompat` class in the `androidx.core.content` package.
