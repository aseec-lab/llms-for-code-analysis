The code in the `ANRequestQueue` class is responsible for managing a queue of network requests. It supports adding, canceling, and finishing requests. It uses a `ConcurrentHashMap` to keep track of the current requests. It also provides methods for checking if a request is running and canceling requests based on tags. The `ANRequestQueue` class is implemented as a singleton, ensuring that only one instance is created throughout the lifecycle of the application.
