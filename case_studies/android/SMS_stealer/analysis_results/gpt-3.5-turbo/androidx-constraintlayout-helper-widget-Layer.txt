The `Layer` class is a helper class in the ConstraintLayout library that extends the `ConstraintHelper` class. It provides functionality for applying transformations and layout features to a group of views.

The class maintains properties such as `mComputedCenterX`, `mComputedCenterY`, `mComputedMaxX`, `mComputedMaxY`, `mComputedMinX`, and `mComputedMinY` to track the center and bounds of the group of views.

The class also provides methods for setting various transformations and layout features, such as rotation, scaling, translation, visibility, and elevation. These methods apply the specified changes to all the views in the group.

The `updatePostLayout` method is called after the layout is computed and updates the layout of the views based on the computed bounds and transformations.

The `updatePreDraw` method is called before drawing the views and updates the rotation angle of the group based on the rotation of the `Layer` view itself.

Overall, the `Layer` class provides a convenient way to apply transformations and layout changes to a group of views in a ConstraintLayout.
