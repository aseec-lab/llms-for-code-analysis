`TooltipCompatHandler` is a class in the AppCompat library that handles tooltips for views. It implements the `View.OnLongClickListener`, `View.OnHoverListener`, and `View.OnAttachStateChangeListener` interfaces. The class manages the showing and hiding of tooltips based on user interactions with the view.

Some key points about the code:

- The `TooltipCompatHandler` class has several constants for defining the timeout durations for hiding tooltips.
- The class keeps track of the active and pending tooltip handlers.
- When `setTooltipText()` is called, it creates a new `TooltipCompatHandler` instance and sets it as the pending handler for the specified view.
- The class handles hover events on the view and shows tooltips if certain conditions are met.
- The `show()` method is responsible for creating a new `TooltipPopup` and showing the tooltip. It also schedules the tooltip to be hidden after a certain timeout.
- The `hide()` method hides the currently active tooltip, if any.
- The class also provides implementations for other event listener methods, but they do not have significant functionality in this context.

Overall, the `TooltipCompatHandler` class facilitates the display of tooltips for views in the AppCompat library.
