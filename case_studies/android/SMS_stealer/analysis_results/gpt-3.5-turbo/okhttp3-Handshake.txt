The `Handshake.java` file in the `okhttp3` package defines the `Handshake` class, which represents the TLS handshake information of a connection. Here is a summary of the code:

- The class has private fields for the TLS version, cipher suite, local certificates, and peer certificates.
- The constructor is private and can only be called by the `get` methods.
- There are two `get` methods: one takes an `SSLSession` object as input and returns a `Handshake` object, and the other takes the TLS version, cipher suite, and certificate lists as input and returns a `Handshake` object.
- The `get(SSLSession paramSSLSession)` method retrieves the TLS version, cipher suite, and certificates from the `SSLSession` object and creates a new `Handshake` object.
- The `get(TlsVersion paramTlsVersion, CipherSuite paramCipherSuite, List<Certificate> paramList1, List<Certificate> paramList2)` method creates a new `Handshake` object with the provided TLS version, cipher suite, and certificate lists.
- The `equals` and `hashCode` methods are overridden to compare and hash the fields of the `Handshake` object.
- The class provides getter methods for accessing the TLS version, cipher suite, local certificates, peer certificates, and principal information.
- The file includes a comment with information about the location of the file and the compiler version.
