The code defines an interface called `DownloadProgressListener`, which is a part of the `com.androidnetworking.interfaces` package.

This interface has one method called `onProgress`, which takes in two parameters: `paramLong1` and `paramLong2`. The `onProgress` method is responsible for providing updates on the progress of a download operation.

Overall, the `DownloadProgressListener` interface provides a mechanism for tracking the progress of a download operation.
