The `KeyFrames` class is used to parse and store keyframes for a MotionLayout animation. It reads keyframe data from an XML file and creates instances of `Key` subclasses based on the specified keyframe type. It also provides methods to add the keyframes to a `MotionController` and retrieve them based on a view ID. The `KeyFrames` class is responsible for parsing the XML file using an `XmlPullParser` and creating the appropriate `Key` objects based on the information found in the XML.
