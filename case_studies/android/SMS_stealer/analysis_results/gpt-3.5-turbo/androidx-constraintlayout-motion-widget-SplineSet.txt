The `SplineSet` class is an abstract class that represents a set of spline values used for animating properties of a view. It contains methods for setting and getting spline points, setting the type of spline, and setting up the spline with a curve fit. It also has a subclass for each supported property type, such as `AlphaSet` for animating the alpha property and `TranslationXSet` for animating the translationX property.The remaining code defines multiple subclasses of the `SplineSet` class:

- `PathRotate`: Sets the rotation of a view based on a path angle.
- `PivotXset`: Sets the pivotX property of a view.
- `PivotYset`: Sets the pivotY property of a view.
- `ProgressSet`: Sets the progress of a MotionLayout or uses reflection to set the progress using the `setProgress` method.
- `RotationSet`: Sets the rotation of a view.
- `RotationXset`: Sets the rotationX of a view.
- `RotationYset`: Sets the rotationY of a view.
- `ScaleXset`: Sets the scaleX of a view.
- `ScaleYset`: Sets the scaleY of a view.
- `Sort`: Contains utility methods for sorting arrays.
- `TranslationXset`: Sets the translationX of a view.
- `TranslationYset`: Sets the translationY of a view.
- `TranslationZset`: Sets the translationZ of a view, only if the device's SDK version is 21 or higher.
