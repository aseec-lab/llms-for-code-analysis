The code represents the `NestedScrollingParent` interface in the `androidx.core.view` package. This interface defines methods for a parent view to implement nested scrolling behavior.

- `getNestedScrollAxes()`: Returns the current nested scroll axes.

- `onNestedFling(View paramView, float paramFloat1, float paramFloat2, boolean paramBoolean)`: Called when a nested scrolling child view flings. 

- `onNestedPreFling(View paramView, float paramFloat1, float paramFloat2)`: Called when a nested scrolling child view wants to fling before the parent consumes the fling.

- `onNestedPreScroll(View paramView, int paramInt1, int paramInt2, int[] paramArrayOfint)`: Called when a nested scrolling child view is about to start scrolling.

- `onNestedScroll(View paramView, int paramInt1, int paramInt2, int paramInt3, int paramInt4)`: Called when a nested scrolling child view has scrolled.

- `onNestedScrollAccepted(View paramView1, View paramView2, int paramInt)`: Called when a nested scrolling child view is about to start scrolling.

- `onStartNestedScroll(View paramView1, View paramView2, int paramInt)`: Called when a nested scrolling child view has started a nested scroll.

- `onStopNestedScroll(View paramView)`: Called when a nested scrolling child view has stopped a nested scroll.
