The code defines the `FragmentManagerNonConfig` class, which is deprecated and is used to store non-configuration data for the FragmentManager. It contains maps for child fragment manager configs and ViewModelStores, as well as a collection of fragments. It offers methods to retrieve these stored values and check if a specific fragment is being retained.
