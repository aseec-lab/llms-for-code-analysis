The `InputDeviceCompat` class in the `androidx.core.view` package defines a set of constants representing input sources for devices.

These constants are used to specify the source of input events in Android applications. Each constant represents a specific input source or a combination of input sources.

Some of the input sources include touchscreens, keyboards, mice, trackballs, joysticks, and gamepads. There are also sources for rotary encoders, styluses, and touchpads.

The constants have integer values that can be used to check the input source of a device and handle input events accordingly.

The class is final, meaning it cannot be subclassed, and it only contains public static final fields representing the input sources.
