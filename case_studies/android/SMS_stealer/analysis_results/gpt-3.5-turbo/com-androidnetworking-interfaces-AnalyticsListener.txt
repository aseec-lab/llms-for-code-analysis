The code defines an interface called `AnalyticsListener`, which is a part of the `com.androidnetworking.interfaces` package.

This interface declares a single method:
1. `onReceived(long paramLong1, long paramLong2, long paramLong3, boolean paramBoolean)`: This method is called when analytics data is received. It takes four parameters of type `long` and `boolean`. The purpose of these parameters is not specified in the code.

The purpose of this interface is to provide a mechanism for listening to analytics events and handling them as needed.
