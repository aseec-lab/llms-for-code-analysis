The code defines an annotation called `Expose` in the `com.google.gson.annotations` package.

The annotation is used to mark fields that should be serialized/deserialized by Gson.

The `Expose` annotation has two elements:
- `deserialize()`: Specifies whether the field should be deserialized. The default value is `true`.
- `serialize()`: Specifies whether the field should be serialized. The default value is `true`.

The annotation is documented and its retention policy is set to `RUNTIME`, which means it can be accessed at runtime using reflection.

The annotation can only be applied to fields using the `@Target` annotation.
