The code in `Easing.java` defines a class `Easing` that is used for defining interpolation functions for motion animations. It provides methods to get the value of the easing function for a given input, as well as the difference in values between two inputs.

The class has an inner class `CubicEasing` that extends `Easing` and represents a cubic easing function. This class defines methods to calculate the x and y values of the cubic easing function, as well as the difference between the y values for a given input.

The `Easing` class also defines constant strings for named easing functions like "standard", "accelerate", "decelerate", and "linear". It provides a `getInterpolator()` method to retrieve an easing function based on a given string input.

Overall, this code provides a way to define and interpolate values for motion animations using various easing functions.
