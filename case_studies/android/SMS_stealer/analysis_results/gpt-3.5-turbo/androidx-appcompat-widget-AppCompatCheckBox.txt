The `AppCompatCheckBox` class is a subclass of `CheckBox` that provides compatibility backports for certain features on different Android versions. It implements the `TintableCompoundButton` and `TintableBackgroundView` interfaces.

The class initializes three helper objects (`AppCompatBackgroundHelper`, `AppCompatCompoundButtonHelper`, and `AppCompatTextHelper`) to handle tinting and other functionality for the checkbox.

It overrides some methods related to drawable state changes, padding calculations, and setting background drawable.

The class also provides methods to get and set the tint color and mode for the checkbox's background and button drawable.

The file is located in the `androidx.appcompat.widget` package.
