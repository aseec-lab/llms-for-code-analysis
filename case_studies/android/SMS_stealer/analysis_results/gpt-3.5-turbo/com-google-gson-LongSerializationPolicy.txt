The code defines an enum called `LongSerializationPolicy` in the `com.google.gson` package. It has two enum constants: `DEFAULT` and `STRING`. 

The `DEFAULT` constant has an implementation of the `serialize` method that converts a `Long` parameter to a `JsonPrimitive` object.

The `STRING` constant does not have an implementation of the `serialize` method.

The enum has a static block that initializes the `STRING` constant and sets the `$VALUES` array.

The enum has an abstract method `serialize` that takes a `Long` parameter and returns a `JsonElement` object.

The code seems to be related to the serialization of Long values in JSON. The `DEFAULT` constant uses the default serialization strategy, while the `STRING` constant likely serializes Long values as strings.
