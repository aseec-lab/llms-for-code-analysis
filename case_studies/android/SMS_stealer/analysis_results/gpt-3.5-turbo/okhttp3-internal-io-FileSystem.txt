The `FileSystem` interface in the `okhttp3.internal.io` package provides a set of methods for working with files in a file system. Here's a summary of what the interface does:

- It defines a `SYSTEM` constant that represents the default file system implementation.
- It provides methods for creating a sink for appending to a file, deleting a file, deleting the contents of a directory, checking if a file exists, renaming a file, creating a sink for writing to a file, getting the size of a file, and creating a source for reading from a file.
