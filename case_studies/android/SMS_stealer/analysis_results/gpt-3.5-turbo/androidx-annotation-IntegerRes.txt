The code defines the `IntegerRes` annotation in the `androidx.annotation` package. This annotation doesn't have any attributes and can be applied to methods, parameters, fields, and local variables.

The `IntegerRes` annotation is used to indicate that the annotated element represents an integer resource. It helps in enforcing proper usage of integer resources and provides additional information to tools and compilers.

The `IntegerRes` annotation has a retention policy of `RetentionPolicy.CLASS`, meaning it is stored in the compiled bytecode but not available at runtime.

This annotation is documented and can be used as a marker for integer resources in the target project.
