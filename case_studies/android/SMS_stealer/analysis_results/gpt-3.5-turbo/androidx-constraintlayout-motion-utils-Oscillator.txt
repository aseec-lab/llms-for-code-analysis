The code in `Oscillator.java` defines a class `Oscillator` that represents an oscillator function with different wave types. It includes methods to add points to the oscillator, calculate the slope and value at a given position, normalize the oscillator, and set the wave type. The class also includes fields to store the position, period, area, and type of the oscillator.
