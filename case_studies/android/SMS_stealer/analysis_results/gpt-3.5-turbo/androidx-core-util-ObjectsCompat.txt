The `ObjectsCompat` class in the `androidx.core.util` package provides utility methods for working with objects.

- The `equals()` method compares two objects for equality. It checks if the `Build.VERSION.SDK_INT` is greater than or equal to 19. If it is, it uses the `Objects.equals()` method to perform the comparison. Otherwise, it checks if the objects are the same instance or if both objects are not null and have the same content using the `equals()` method.

- The `hash()` method computes a hash code for the given array of objects. It checks if the `Build.VERSION.SDK_INT` is greater than or equal to 19. If it is, it uses the `Objects.hash()` method to compute the hash code. Otherwise, it uses the `Arrays.hashCode()` method.

- The `hashCode()` method computes the hash code for a single object. It checks if the given object is not null and returns its hash code, or returns 0 if the object is null.
