The `ParcelField` interface is an annotation provided by the AndroidX library. It is used to annotate fields in classes that implement versioned parcelable objects.

This annotation is used to define a field and its associated value in a versioned parcelable object. It is used in conjunction with the `VersionedParcel` class to serialize and deserialize data.

The `ParcelField` annotation includes two elements:
- `defaultValue`: Specifies the default value for the annotated field.
- `value`: Specifies the value for the annotated field.

The retention policy for this annotation is set to `SOURCE`, which means it is discarded by the compiler and not included in the generated bytecode.

The `Target` annotation is used to specify that the `ParcelField` annotation can only be applied to fields.

The `ParcelField` annotation does not contain any additional logic or behavior. It is used as a marker and metadata to identify and process fields in versioned parcelable objects.
