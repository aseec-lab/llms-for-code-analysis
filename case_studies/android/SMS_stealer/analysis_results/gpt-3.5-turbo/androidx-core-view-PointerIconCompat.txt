The `PointerIconCompat` class in the `androidx.core.view` package provides compatibility methods for working with `PointerIcon` objects in Android.

The class defines constants for different types of pointer icons such as arrows, hands, text, and more.

The class has a private field `mPointerIcon` to store the `PointerIcon` object.

The class provides static methods to create pointer icons from a `Bitmap`, get system icons based on an `int` identifier, and load pointer icons from `Resources`.

The `create` method creates a `PointerIconCompat` object using the `PointerIcon.create` method if the Android version is 24 or higher. Otherwise, it creates an instance with a null `PointerIcon` object.

The `getSystemIcon` method retrieves a system-defined pointer icon using the `PointerIcon.getSystemIcon` method if the Android version is 24 or higher. Otherwise, it creates an instance with a null `PointerIcon` object.

The `load` method loads a pointer icon from resources using the `PointerIcon.load` method if the Android version is 24 or higher. Otherwise, it creates an instance with a null `PointerIcon` object.

The `getPointerIcon` method returns the stored `mPointerIcon` object.
