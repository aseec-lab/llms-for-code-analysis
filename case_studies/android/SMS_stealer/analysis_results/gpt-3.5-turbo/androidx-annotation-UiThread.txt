The code defines the `UiThread` annotation in the `androidx.annotation` package. This annotation is used to indicate that a method, constructor, type, or parameter should be accessed only from the UI thread. The annotation has a retention policy of `RetentionPolicy.CLASS`, meaning it is retained in the compiled bytecode.
