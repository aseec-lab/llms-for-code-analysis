The `Response.java` file in the `okhttp3` package defines the `Response` class, which represents an HTTP response.

Here is a summary of the code:
- The class has private fields for the response body, cache control, cache response, code, handshake, headers, message, network response, prior response, protocol, received response time, request, and sent request time.
- The constructor initializes the fields with the values provided by a `Builder` object.
- The class provides getter methods for the response body, cache control, cache response, code, handshake, headers, message, network response, prior response, protocol, received response time, request, and sent request time.
- The `body()` method returns the response body as a `ResponseBody` object.
- The `cacheControl()` method parses the cache control headers and returns a `CacheControl` object.
- The `cacheResponse()` method returns the cache response as a `Response` object.
- The `challenges()` method returns a list of challenges in the response headers.
- The `close()` method closes the response body.
- The `code()` method returns the response code.
- The `handshake()` method returns the handshake used during the SSL/TLS connection.
- The `header(String)` method returns the value of the specified header.
- The `header(String, String)` method returns the value of the specified header, or a default value if it is not present.
- The `headers(String)` method returns a list of values for the specified header.
- The `headers()` method returns the response headers as a `Headers` object.
- The `isRedirect()` method returns true if the response is a redirect response.
- The `isSuccessful()` method returns true if the response code indicates a successful response.
- The `message()` method returns the response message.
- The `networkResponse()` method returns the network response as a `Response` object.
- The `newBuilder()` method creates a new `Builder` object with the same values as the current response.
- The `peekBody(long)` method returns a peeked copy of the response body up to a specified length.
- The `priorResponse()` method returns the prior response as a `Response` object.
- The `protocol()` method returns the protocol used for the response.
- The `receivedResponseAtMillis()` method returns the timestamp when the response was received.
- The `request()` method returns the request that resulted in this response.
- The `sentRequestAtMillis()` method returns the timestamp when the request was sent.
- The `toString()` method returns a string representation of the response.
- The `Builder` class is a builder for creating `Response` objects.
- The `Builder` class provides methods for setting the response code, message, headers, body, and other properties.
- The `Builder` class has a `build()` method that creates a new `Response` object with the provided values.The `Builder` class in the `Response.java` file of the `okhttp3` package provides methods for building the `Response` object.
- The `body()` method sets the response body.
- The `build()` method checks if all necessary properties are set and creates a new `Response` object.
- The `cacheResponse()` method sets the cache response.
- The `code()` method sets the response code.
- The `handshake()` method sets the SSL/TLS handshake.
- The `header()` method sets a header with the specified key and value.
- The `headers()` method sets the response headers.
- The `message()` method sets the response message.
- The `networkResponse()` method sets the network response.
- The `priorResponse()` method sets the prior response.
- The `protocol()` method sets the protocol used for the response.
- The `receivedResponseAtMillis()` method sets the timestamp when the response was received.
- The `removeHeader()` method removes the header with the specified key.
- The `request()` method sets the request that resulted in the response.
- The `sentRequestAtMillis()` method sets the timestamp when the request was sent.
