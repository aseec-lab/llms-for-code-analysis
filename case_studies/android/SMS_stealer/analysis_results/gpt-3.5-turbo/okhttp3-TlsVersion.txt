The `TlsVersion` class in the `okhttp3` package represents the versions of the TLS protocol. It is an enum that includes the versions SSL 3.0, TLS 1.0, TLS 1.1, TLS 1.2, and TLS 1.3. Each version has a corresponding Java name. The class provides methods to get the Java name of a TLS version and to convert a Java name to a `TlsVersion` object. It also provides a utility method to convert an array of Java names to a list of `TlsVersion` objects. The class uses an internal array `$VALUES` to store the available TLS versions.
