The `MediaType` class in the `okhttp3` package is used to parse and represent media types.

Here are the key points of the code:

- The class defines constants for regular expressions used for parsing media types.
- It has fields for storing the media type, subtype, type, and charset.
- The `parse` method is used to parse a media type string and create a `MediaType` object.
- The `charset` method is used to get the charset of the media type.
- The `equals` and `hashCode` methods are overridden for comparing `MediaType` objects.
- The `subtype` method returns the subtype of the media type.
- The `toString` method returns the media type string.
- The `type` method returns the type of the media type.

Overall, the `MediaType` class provides methods to parse, represent, and manipulate media types in a convenient way.
