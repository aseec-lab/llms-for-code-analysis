This code defines the `AlertDialogLayout` class, which extends `LinearLayoutCompat` and is used for laying out the views in an `AlertDialog`.
The class provides constructors that accept a `Context` and `AttributeSet` parameter.
It includes methods for measuring and laying out the child views within the layout.
The `tryOnMeasure` method is responsible for measuring the child views and determining the size of the layout.
The `onLayout` method is responsible for placing the child views within the layout.
The `onMeasure` method is overridden to call `tryOnMeasure`, allowing the layout to handle measuring the child views.
