The `AppCompatPopupWindow` class in the `androidx.appcompat.widget` package is a custom implementation of the `PopupWindow` class. 

Key points about the code:

- It extends the base `PopupWindow` class.
- It has a boolean field `mOverlapAnchor` to determine if the popup should overlap its anchor.
- It initializes the `COMPAT_OVERLAP_ANCHOR` static boolean field based on the Android version.
- It has two constructors that call the `init()` method.
- The `init()` method obtains styled attributes for the `PopupWindow` from the theme using `TintTypedArray`.
- It sets the overlap anchor property and the background drawable using the obtained attributes.
- It defines the `setSupportOverlapAnchor()` method to set the overlap anchor property based on the Android version.
- It overrides the `showAsDropDown()`, `showAsDropDown()`, and `update()` methods to handle overlap anchor if necessary.
