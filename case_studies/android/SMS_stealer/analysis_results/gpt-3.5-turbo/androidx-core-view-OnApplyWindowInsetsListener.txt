The `OnApplyWindowInsetsListener` interface, located in the `androidx.core.view` package, defines a single method `onApplyWindowInsets()`.

The `onApplyWindowInsets()` method is called when window insets are applied to a `View`. It takes two parameters: `paramView`, which represents the `View` that the insets are being applied to, and `paramWindowInsetsCompat`, which represents the window insets that are being applied.

The method returns a `WindowInsetsCompat` object, which represents the updated window insets after they have been applied to the view.

This interface is typically implemented by a `View` or a custom view to define custom behavior when window insets are applied.
