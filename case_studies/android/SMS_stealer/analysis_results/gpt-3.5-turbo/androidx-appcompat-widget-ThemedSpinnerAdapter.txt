- The `Helper` class has a constructor that takes a `Context` parameter and initializes the member variables.
- The `getDropDownViewInflater()` method returns the `LayoutInflater` used for creating dropdown views.
- The `getDropDownViewTheme()` method returns the theme used for dropdown views, which is obtained from the `LayoutInflater`.
