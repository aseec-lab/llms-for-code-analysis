The `NestedScrollingParent2` interface in the `androidx.core.view` package is an extension of the `NestedScrollingParent` interface. It provides additional methods for handling nested scrolling events in a parent view.

The interface includes the following methods:
- `onNestedPreScroll`: Called when a nested scrolling child view is being scrolled before the scroll event is consumed. It allows the parent view to respond to the scroll before the child view.
- `onNestedScroll`: Called when a nested scrolling child view has been scrolled. It allows the parent view to respond to the scroll event after the child view.
- `onNestedScrollAccepted`: Called when a nested scrolling child view is accepting a nested scroll operation. It allows the parent view to prepare for the nested scroll.
- `onStartNestedScroll`: Called when a nested scrolling child view starts a nested scroll operation. It allows the parent view to decide whether to support the nested scrolling operation.
- `onStopNestedScroll`: Called when a nested scrolling child view has stopped a nested scroll operation. It allows the parent view to clean up after the nested scroll.

These methods provide a way for a parent view to handle and react to nested scrolling events from its child views.
