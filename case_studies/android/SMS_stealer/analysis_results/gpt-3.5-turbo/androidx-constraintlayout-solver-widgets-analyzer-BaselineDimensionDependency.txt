The `BaselineDimensionDependency` class extends the `DimensionDependency` class. It has a constructor that takes a `WidgetRun` parameter and calls the super constructor. The class overrides the `update` method, which updates the baseline margin of the vertical widget run based on the baseline distance obtained from the widget. The `resolved` variable is set to `true` in this method.
