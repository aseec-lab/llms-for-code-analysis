The `CacheRequest` interface defines methods for manipulating and writing the request body to the cache. 

The `abort` method is used to abort the request and cancel writing to the cache. 

The `body` method returns a `Sink` object, which represents the destination where the request body should be written. It throws an `IOException` if there is an error while writing the request body.

This interface is used by classes within the `okhttp3.internal.cache` package to manage caching of HTTP requests and responses.
