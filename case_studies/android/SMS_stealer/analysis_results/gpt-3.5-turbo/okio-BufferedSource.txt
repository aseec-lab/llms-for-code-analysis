The `BufferedSource` interface in the `okio` package provides methods for reading data from a source.

- It extends the `Source` interface, which means it can read data from a source.
- It also extends the `ReadableByteChannel` interface, which means it can read data from a channel.
- The `buffer()` method returns the underlying buffer for this source.
- The `exhausted()` method checks if there is no more data to be read from the source.
- The `indexOf()` methods search for the index of a specified byte or `ByteString` in the source.
- The `inputStream()` method returns an `InputStream` for reading from the source.
- The `rangeEquals()` methods check if a range of bytes in the source is equal to a specified byte string.
- The `read()` methods read bytes from the source into a byte array or buffer.
- The `readAll()` method reads all data from the source and writes it to a `Sink`.
- The `readByte()` and `readByteArray()` methods read bytes from the source.
- The `readByteString()` methods read a `ByteString` from the source.
- The `readDecimalLong()` method reads a decimal long value from the source.
- The `readFully()` methods read bytes from the source and write them to a buffer or byte array.
- The `readHexadecimalUnsignedLong()` method reads a hexadecimal unsigned long value from the source.
- The `readInt()` and `readLong()` methods read integer and long values from the source.
- The `readShort()` method reads a short value from the source.
- The `readString()` and `readUtf8()` methods read strings from the source in the specified charset or UTF-8 encoding.
- The `readUtf8CodePoint()` method reads a UTF-8 code point from the source.
- The `readUtf8Line()` methods read a line of text in UTF-8 encoding from the source.
- The `request()` method requests a specific number of bytes from the source.
- The `require()` method reads a specific number of bytes from the source, throwing an exception if the required bytes are not available.
- The `select()` method selects the index of the first option that matches the data in the source.
- The `skip()` method skips a specific number of bytes in the source.
