The `PopupWindowCompat` class in the `androidx.core.widget` package provides compatibility methods for working with `PopupWindow` on different versions of Android.

Here's a summary of what the code does:

- The class includes methods to get and set various properties of a `PopupWindow` such as overlap anchor and window layout type.
- The methods in this class check the current Android version and use the appropriate methods available on that version.
- The `getOverlapAnchor()` method retrieves whether the popup window overlaps its anchor.
- The `getWindowLayoutType()` method retrieves the type of layout used for the popup window.
- The `setOverlapAnchor()` method sets whether the popup window overlaps its anchor.
- The `setWindowLayoutType()` method sets the type of layout used for the popup window.
- The `showAsDropDown()` method shows the popup window as a drop-down view below a specified anchor view, adjusting the position based on the version of Android.

These methods allow developers to work with `PopupWindow` consistently across different Android versions.
