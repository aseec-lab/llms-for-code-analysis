The `InternalCache` interface in the `okhttp3.internal.cache` package defines methods for interacting with an internal cache. It contains methods for retrieving a cached response based on a given request, adding a response to the cache, removing a cached response, tracking cache hits, tracking responses, and updating cached responses.
