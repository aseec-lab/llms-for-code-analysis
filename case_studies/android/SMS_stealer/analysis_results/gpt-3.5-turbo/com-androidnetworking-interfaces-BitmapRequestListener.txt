The code defines an interface called `BitmapRequestListener`, which is a part of the `com.androidnetworking.interfaces` package.

This interface declares two methods:
1. `onError(ANError paramANError)`: This method is called when an error occurs during a bitmap request. It takes a parameter of type `ANError` which represents the error.
2. `onResponse(Bitmap paramBitmap)`: This method is called when a bitmap response is received. It takes a parameter of type `Bitmap` which represents the received bitmap.

The purpose of this interface is to provide a mechanism for listening to bitmap request events and handling the response or error as needed.
