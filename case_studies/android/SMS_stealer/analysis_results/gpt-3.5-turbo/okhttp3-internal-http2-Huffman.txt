The code in the `Huffman` class is responsible for encoding and decoding data using the Huffman coding algorithm. 

The class contains a tree structure representing the Huffman codes, where each leaf node corresponds to a symbol and its associated code. The codes and code lengths are defined in the `CODES` and `CODE_LENGTHS` arrays.

The class provides methods for encoding and decoding byte arrays and `ByteString` objects. The `encode` method takes a `ByteString` and writes the encoded representation to a `BufferedSink` object. The `decode` method takes a byte array and returns the decoded byte array.
