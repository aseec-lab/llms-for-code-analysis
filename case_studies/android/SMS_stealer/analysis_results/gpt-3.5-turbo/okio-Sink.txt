The `Sink` interface in the `okio` package provides methods for writing data to a destination.

- It extends the `Closeable` and `Flushable` interfaces, which means it can be closed and flushed.
- The `close()` method closes the sink and releases any system resources associated with it. It throws an `IOException` if an I/O error occurs.
- The `flush()` method flushes the sink, ensuring that any buffered data is written to the destination. It throws an `IOException` if an I/O error occurs.
- The `timeout()` method returns the timeout object associated with the sink. A timeout can be set to control the maximum time allowed for writing data.
- The `write()` method writes data from a `Buffer` object to the sink. The second parameter specifies the number of bytes to write. It throws an `IOException` if an I/O error occurs.
