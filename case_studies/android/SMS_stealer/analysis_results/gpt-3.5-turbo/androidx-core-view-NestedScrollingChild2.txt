The `NestedScrollingChild2` interface in the `androidx.core.view` package is an extension of the `NestedScrollingChild` interface. It provides additional methods for nested scrolling operations.

The interface includes the following methods:
- `dispatchNestedPreScroll`: Dispatches a pre-scroll event to a nested scrolling parent view. It allows the parent to consume a portion of the scroll before the child view.
- `dispatchNestedScroll`: Dispatches a scroll event to a nested scrolling parent view. It allows the parent view to respond to the scroll event after the child view.
- `hasNestedScrollingParent`: Checks if there is a nested scrolling parent view.
- `startNestedScroll`: Notifies a nested scrolling parent view that a nested scroll operation is starting. It allows the parent view to decide whether to support the nested scrolling operation.
- `stopNestedScroll`: Notifies a nested scrolling parent view that a nested scroll operation has stopped. It allows the parent view to clean up after the nested scroll.

These methods provide a way for a nested scrolling child view to interact with its parent view during a nested scroll operation.
