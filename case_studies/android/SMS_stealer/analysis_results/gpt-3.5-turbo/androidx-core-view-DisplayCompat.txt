The `DisplayCompat` class in the `androidx.core.view` package provides compatibility methods for working with display-related functionality. It includes methods for getting the physical size of a display, checking if the display is a Sony Bravia 4k TV, checking if the device is a TV, and parsing display size from system properties. It also provides a `ModeCompat` inner class for wrapping display modes.
