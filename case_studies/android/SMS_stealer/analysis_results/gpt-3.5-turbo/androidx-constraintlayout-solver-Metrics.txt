The `Metrics` class in the `androidx.constraintlayout.solver` package contains properties and methods for tracking various metrics related to the solving process in a constraint layout solver.

- The class defines numerous `long` properties that represent different metrics such as the number of measures, additional measures, resolutions, table size changes, etc.
- The `problematicLayouts` property is an `ArrayList` that stores the names of layouts that cause problems during solving.
- The `reset()` method resets all the metrics to zero and clears the `problematicLayouts` list.
- The `toString()` method generates a string representation of the metrics, mainly displaying values for measures, measuresWrap, measuresWrapInfeasible, determineGroups, infeasibleDetermineGroups, graphOptimizer, widgets, graphSolved, and linearSolved.
