The `VersionedParcelize` annotation is used in the AndroidX library to mark classes that can be serialized/deserialized using versioned parceling.
- The `allowSerialization` attribute determines if the annotated class can be serialized.
- The `deprecatedIds` attribute specifies an array of deprecated field IDs.
- The `factory` attribute specifies the factory class to use for creating instances of the annotated class.
- The `ignoreParcelables` attribute determines if the annotated class should ignore other parcelable classes.
- The `isCustom` attribute indicates if the annotated class uses custom serialization/deserialization logic.
- The `jetifyAs` attribute is used for migration purposes when converting code from the Android Support Library to AndroidX.

The annotation is applied to classes. It is used at the source level and does not have any effect at runtime.
