The GuidelineReference class is a subclass of WidgetRun, responsible for managing the properties and behavior of a Guideline widget in the ConstraintLayout solver. 

The class has the following features:
- It initializes the GuidelineReference with a ConstraintWidget and stores its orientation.
- It applies the properties of the Guideline to the solver by adding dependencies to the start and end of the GuidelineReference.
- It applies the Guideline's value to the widget's position based on its orientation.
- It provides methods to clear and reset the GuidelineReference.
- It determines whether the Guideline supports wrap computation.
- It updates the GuidelineReference based on a given dependency, resolving the start value if ready.
