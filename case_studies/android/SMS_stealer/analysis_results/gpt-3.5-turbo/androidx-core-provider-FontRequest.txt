The `FontRequest` class in the `androidx.core.provider` package represents a font request. It is used to request fonts from a font provider.

The class has two constructors, one that takes the provider authority, package name, query, and an integer as parameters, and another that takes the same parameters plus a list of certificates.

The class provides getters for the various properties of the font request, such as the provider authority, package name, query, certificates, and the identifier.

The class also overrides the `toString()` method to provide a string representation of the font request, including the provider authority, package name, query, and certificates.
