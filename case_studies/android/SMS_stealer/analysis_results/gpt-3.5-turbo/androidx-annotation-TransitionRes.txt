The code defines the `TransitionRes` annotation in the `androidx.annotation` package. This annotation is used to annotate methods, parameters, and fields that represent resource references to transition animations.

The `TransitionRes` annotation has a retention policy of `RetentionPolicy.SOURCE`, meaning it is not retained in the compiled bytecode and is only available at the source code level.

The `TransitionRes` annotation can be applied to the following elements:
- `ElementType.METHOD`: to annotate methods that return a transition resource reference.
- `ElementType.PARAMETER`: to annotate method parameters that accept a transition resource reference.
- `ElementType.FIELD`: to annotate fields that store a transition resource reference.
