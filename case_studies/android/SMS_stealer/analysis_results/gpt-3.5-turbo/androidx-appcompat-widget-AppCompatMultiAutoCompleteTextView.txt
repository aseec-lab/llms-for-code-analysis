The code defines the `AppCompatMultiAutoCompleteTextView` class, which is a subclass of `MultiAutoCompleteTextView` and implements the `TintableBackgroundView` interface. 

It provides constructors for creating an instance of the class with different parameters. 

The class initializes the `AppCompatBackgroundHelper` and `AppCompatTextHelper` objects, which are used to apply background tint and text appearance to the view. 

The `drawableStateChanged` method updates the background tint and compound drawables when the view's state changes. 

The class overrides the `onCreateInputConnection` method to create an `InputConnection` object for the view. 

It also provides methods to get and set the background tint and background tint mode, as well as methods to set the background drawable and text appearance.
