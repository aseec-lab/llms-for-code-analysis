The `TypefaceCompatApi26Impl` class is a subclass of `TypefaceCompatApi21Impl`. It provides implementation for working with Typefaces on API 26 and above.

It defines several constants for method names and class names related to Typeface creation and manipulation. It also declares fields for storing Java reflection methods and constructor references that will be used for calling private methods and classes.

The class implements various methods for managing Typefaces, including adding fonts from asset managers or buffers, freezing Typefaces, creating new Typefaces from font families, and obtaining necessary methods via Java reflection.

There are also additional methods for aborting Typefaces creation, checking if certain private APIs needed for font management are available, and creating a new FontFamily object.

The class overrides some methods from its superclass to support font creation and retrieval specifically for API 26 and above. It also provides fallback implementations for older versions of the Android framework.
