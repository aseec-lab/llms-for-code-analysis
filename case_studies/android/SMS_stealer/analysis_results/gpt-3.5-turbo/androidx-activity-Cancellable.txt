The code in the `Cancellable.java` file defines an interface called `Cancellable`. This interface has a single method called `cancel()`, which does not accept any arguments and does not return any value.

The purpose of this interface is to provide a common contract for objects that can be canceled. By implementing this interface, a class can define its own logic for cancelling or stopping a particular operation or task.
