The `ActionBarPolicy` class is part of the AppCompat library in Android. It provides policy and configuration settings related to the Action Bar.

The `ActionBarPolicy` class has the following methods:

1. `enableHomeButtonByDefault()`: Returns a boolean value indicating whether the home button should be enabled by default. The decision is based on the target SDK version of the application.

2. `getEmbeddedMenuWidthLimit()`: Returns the maximum width of the embedded menu in pixels. It is calculated as half of the screen width.

3. `getMaxActionButtons()`: Returns the maximum number of action buttons that should be displayed on the Action Bar. The decision is based on the screen size and configuration.

4. `getStackedTabMaxWidth()`: Returns the maximum width of a stacked tab in the Action Bar.

5. `getTabContainerHeight()`: Returns the height of the tab container in the Action Bar. The height is obtained from the theme's style attributes, and it is adjusted if the Action Bar has embedded tabs.

6. `hasEmbeddedTabs()`: Returns a boolean value indicating whether the Action Bar has embedded tabs.

7. `showsOverflowMenuButton()`: Returns a boolean value indicating whether the overflow menu button should be shown. The decision is based on the device's SDK version and the presence of a permanent menu key.

These methods provide policy and configuration settings for the Action Bar based on the device's resources and the application's target SDK version.
