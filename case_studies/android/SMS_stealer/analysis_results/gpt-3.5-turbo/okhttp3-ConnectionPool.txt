The `ConnectionPool` class in the `okhttp3` package represents a pool of connections that can be reused for making HTTP requests. It manages the lifecycle of connections and performs cleanup operations to remove idle or leaked connections.

Here are the key points of the code:

- The `ConnectionPool` class uses a `Deque` to store the `RealConnection` instances.
- It has a `cleanupRunnable` that is executed periodically to clean up idle connections.
- The `cleanup` method prunes the connections based on their idle time and returns the time until the next cleanup.
- The `connectionBecameIdle` method removes a connection from the pool if it is idle and has no active streams.
- The `connectionCount` method returns the number of connections currently in the pool.
- The `deduplicate` method checks if a multiplexed connection is available for a given address and stream allocation and returns it if found.
- The `evictAll` method shuts down all the connections in the pool.The remaining code includes the following:

- The `get` method tries to find a suitable connection in the pool for a given address, stream allocation, and route. If a connection is found, it is acquired by the stream allocation and returned.
- The `idleConnectionCount` method returns the count of idle connections in the pool.
- The `put` method adds a connection to the pool and starts the cleanup process if it is not already running.

The code also includes exception handling and synchronization blocks to ensure thread safety.
