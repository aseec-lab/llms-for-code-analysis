The `DownloadListener` interface is a part of the com.androidnetworking.interfaces package. It declares two methods:
1. `onDownloadComplete()`: This method is called when the download is complete.
2. `onError(ANError paramANError)`: This method is called when an error occurs during the download, with the error information passed as a parameter of type `ANError`.

The purpose of this interface is to provide a mechanism for listening to download events and handling success and error cases.
