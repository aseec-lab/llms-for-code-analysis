The code defines an annotation called `OnLifecycleEvent` in the `androidx.lifecycle` package. 

This annotation is used to annotate methods and indicates that the annotated method should be called when a specific `Lifecycle.Event` occurs.

The `OnLifecycleEvent` annotation has a single element called `value`, which represents the `Lifecycle.Event` that triggers the annotated method.
