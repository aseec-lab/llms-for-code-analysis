The code defines the `PushObserver` interface, which is used for observing server push operations in an HTTP/2 connection.

The `PushObserver` interface has four methods:
- `onData()` is called when data is received from the server push.
- `onHeaders()` is called when headers are received from the server push.
- `onRequest()` is called when a new server push request is received.
- `onReset()` is called when a server push is reset.

The interface also provides a static `CANCEL` instance, which is a default implementation of `PushObserver` that simply ignores all push events.
