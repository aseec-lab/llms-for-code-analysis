The code defines an interface called `UnrepeatableRequestBody` in the package `okhttp3.internal.http`. There is no implementation provided in this code file, as the interface is empty.

It appears that this interface is used within the OkHttp library, but without further context or information, it is difficult to determine its exact purpose. However, based on the name of the interface, it is likely related to requests that cannot be repeated, such as in single-use or one-time operations.
