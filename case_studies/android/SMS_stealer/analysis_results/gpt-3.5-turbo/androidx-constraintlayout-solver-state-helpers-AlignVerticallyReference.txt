The `AlignVerticallyReference` class extends the `HelperReference` class and is used to handle vertical alignment in ConstraintLayout.

Here's a summary of what the code does:

- The class has private fields to store the vertical alignment references for top to top, top to bottom, bottom to top, and bottom to bottom.
- The constructor takes a State object as a parameter and assigns it to the superclass field.
- The `apply` method is used to apply the vertical alignment constraints to the referenced constraint references.
- The `bias` method is used to set the vertical bias of the alignment.
- The `bottomToBottom`, `bottomToTop`, `topToBottom`, and `topToTop` methods are used to set the vertical alignment references.
