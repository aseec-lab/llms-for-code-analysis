The `AnyThread` annotation is used to annotate methods, constructors, types, and parameters in the `androidx.annotation` package. It is a `@Retention` annotation with a policy of `CLASS`, meaning it is retained during compile time and available for inspection at runtime. It is also `@Documented`, meaning it will be included in the generated API documentation. This annotation is used to indicate that the annotated element can be accessed from any thread.
