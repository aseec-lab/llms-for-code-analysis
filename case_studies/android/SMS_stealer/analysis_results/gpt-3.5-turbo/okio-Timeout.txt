The `Timeout` class in the `okio` package provides a mechanism for setting and managing timeouts for IO operations.

- The class has fields for tracking the deadline time and the timeout duration in nanoseconds.
- It provides methods for setting the deadline, clearing the deadline, setting the timeout duration, and clearing the timeout.
- The class also has methods for checking if a deadline or timeout is set, and for throwing an exception if the timeout has been reached.
- The `waitUntilNotified` method is used to wait until a signal is received or the timeout is reached.
- The `NONE` constant represents a timeout with no deadline and no timeout duration.
