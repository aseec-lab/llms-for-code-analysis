The `JsonWriter` class in the `com.google.gson.stream` package is responsible for writing JSON data to a `Writer` object. It provides methods for writing JSON arrays, objects, strings, and other values. The class maintains a stack to keep track of the current scope of the JSON document being written. It also handles indentation, escaping characters, and HTML-safe output. The class implements the `Closeable` and `Flushable` interfaces, allowing the writer to be closed and flushed when done writing.The remaining part of the code includes various methods in the `JsonWriter` class for writing JSON values to the output `Writer`.
- `setIndent(String)` sets the indentation string that will be used for each level of nesting in the JSON document.
- `setLenient(boolean)` sets whether the writer should be lenient in accepting non-standard JSON values like NaN and infinite numbers.
- `setSerializeNulls(boolean)` sets whether the writer should serialize null values.
- `value(double)` writes a double value to the JSON document.
- `value(long)` writes a long value to the JSON document.
- `value(Boolean)` writes a boolean value to the JSON document.
- `value(Number)` writes a number value to the JSON document.
- `value(String)` writes a string value to the JSON document.
- `value(boolean)` writes a boolean value to the JSON document.
