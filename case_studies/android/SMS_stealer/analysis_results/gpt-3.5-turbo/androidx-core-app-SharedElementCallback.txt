The `SharedElementCallback` class is part of the `androidx.core.app` package and provides methods that allow customization of shared element transitions between activities. 

The methods in this class include:
- `onCaptureSharedElementSnapshot()`: Captures a snapshot of a shared element view and returns it as a `Parcelable`.
- `onCreateSnapshotView()`: Creates a snapshot view of a shared element using the captured snapshot `Parcelable`, typically used for postponed shared element transitions.
- `onMapSharedElements()`: Maps shared element names to their corresponding views.
- `onRejectSharedElements()`: Notifies the callback when shared elements are rejected.
- `onSharedElementEnd()`: Notifies the callback when shared element transition ends.
- `onSharedElementStart()`: Notifies the callback when shared element transition starts.
- `onSharedElementsArrived()`: Notifies the callback when shared elements arrive at the destination.

The `SharedElementCallback` class also includes an inner interface `OnSharedElementsReadyListener` that provides a callback when shared elements are ready.
