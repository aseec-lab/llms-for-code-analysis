The code defines the `MainThread` annotation in the `androidx.annotation` package. This annotation is used to annotate methods, constructors, types, and parameters that should be accessed or executed on the main thread.

The `MainThread` annotation is documented and has a retention policy of `RetentionPolicy.CLASS`, meaning it is stored in the compiled bytecode but not available at runtime.

The `MainThread` annotation can be applied to methods, constructors, types, and parameters using the `@Target` annotation.

The code does not contain any functional logic. It only defines the `MainThread` annotation and its associated target elements.
