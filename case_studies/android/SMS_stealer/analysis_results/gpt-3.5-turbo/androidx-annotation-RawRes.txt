The code defines the `RawRes` annotation in the `androidx.annotation` package. This annotation is used to annotate parameters, methods, local variables, and fields that represent resource IDs for raw resources. The annotation has a retention policy of `RetentionPolicy.CLASS`, meaning it is retained in the bytecode of the compiled class files.
