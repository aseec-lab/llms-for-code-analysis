The `AppCompatToggleButton` class extends the `ToggleButton` class and is a part of the AppCompat library. It provides compatibility for the ToggleButton widget in older versions of Android.

The class initializes an instance of `AppCompatTextHelper` to handle text-related functionality for the toggle button.

There are three constructors available. The first constructor initializes the toggle button with only the context. The second constructor initializes it with the context and attribute set. The third constructor initializes it with the context, attribute set, and a default style attribute.

The `ThemeUtils.checkAppCompatTheme()` method is called to ensure that the toggle button is using an AppCompat theme.

The `loadFromAttributes()` method of the `AppCompatTextHelper` class is called to load and apply any text-related attributes specified in the attribute set.

Overall, the `AppCompatToggleButton` class provides compatibility and helps in applying AppCompat themes and attributes to the ToggleButton widget.
