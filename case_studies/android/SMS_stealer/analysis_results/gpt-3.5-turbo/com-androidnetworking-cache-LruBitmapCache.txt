The code defines a class named `LruBitmapCache` in the package `com.androidnetworking.cache`.

The class extends the `LruCache` class and implements the `ANImageLoader.ImageCache` interface.

It provides methods for caching and retrieving `Bitmap` objects using a Least Recently Used (LRU) algorithm.

The `LruBitmapCache` class has a constructor that takes an integer as a parameter to set the maximum cache size.

It provides methods to evict all bitmaps from the cache, evict a specific bitmap by its key, get a bitmap by its key, and put a bitmap into the cache with a specific key.

The `sizeOf` method is overridden to calculate the size of a bitmap in bytes based on its row bytes and height.

The `LruBitmapCache` class is used as a cache for storing and retrieving bitmaps in an Android network image loader.
