The `ArrayRow` class in the `androidx.constraintlayout.solver` package represents a row in a linear system solver.

The class stores information about the row, such as the constant value and whether it is a simple definition.
It also has a reference to a `SolverVariable` object and an `ArrayRowVariables` object, which manages the variables in the row.

The class provides methods for adding errors to the row, adding a single error to a solver variable, and choosing a subject in the row based on certain criteria.

The class is used to represent rows in the solver and perform calculations on them.The `createRow` methods in the `ArrayRow` class are used to create different types of rows in a linear system solver.

- `createRowDefinition`: Creates a row that defines the value of a variable as a constant.
- `createRowDimensionPercent`: Creates a row that represents a dimension as a percentage of another dimension.
- `createRowDimensionRatio`: Creates a row that represents a dimension as a ratio of other dimensions.
- `createRowEqualDimension`: Creates a row that represents two dimensions as equal with optional offset values.
- `createRowEqualMatchDimensions`: Creates a row that represents multiple dimensions as equal with optional offset values.
- `createRowEquals`: Creates a row that represents the equality or inequality of a variable with a constant or another variable.
- `createRowGreaterThan`: Creates a row that represents a variable being greater than a constant or another variable.
- `createRowLowerThan`: Creates a row that represents a variable being lower than a constant or another variable.
- `createRowWithAngle`: Creates a row that represents an angle between two vectors.

These methods set the variables and constant value of the row, and return the modified `ArrayRow` object.The `updateFromFinalVariable` method in the `ArrayRow` class updates the row based on a final variable in a linear system solver.

- If the variable is not a final value, the method returns.
- The method updates the constant value of the row by adding the product of the variable's computed value and its coefficient in the row to the current constant value.
- The method removes the variable from the row's variables and its corresponding weight.
- If the variable was removed from the row's variables, it is also removed from the variable's row.
- If the flag `paramBoolean` is `true`, the variable is removed from the row's variables and its corresponding weight.
- If the flag `paramBoolean` is `true`, the method checks if the row has no more variables, and if so, sets the `isSimpleDefinition` flag of the row and the linear system's `hasSimpleDefinition` flag to `true`.The remaining methods in the `ArrayRow` class:

- `clear()`: Clears the row by removing all variables and setting the constant value to 0.
- `contains(SolverVariable param1SolverVariable)`: Checks if the row contains a specific variable.
- `display()`: Prints the equation represented by the row.
- `divideByAmount(float param1Float)`: Divides every coefficient and the constant value of the row by a given amount.
- `get(SolverVariable param1SolverVariable)`: Gets the coefficient of a specific variable in the row.
- `getCurrentSize()`: Returns the current number of variables in the row.
- `getVariable(int param1Int)`: Returns the variable at a specific index in the row.
- `getVariableValue(int param1Int)`: Returns the value of the variable at a specific index in the row.
- `indexOf(SolverVariable param1SolverVariable)`: Returns the index of a specific variable in the row.
- `invert()`: Inverts the sign of every coefficient and the constant value in the row.
- `put(SolverVariable param1SolverVariable, float param1Float)`: Sets the coefficient of a specific variable in the row.
- `remove(SolverVariable param1SolverVariable, boolean param1Boolean)`: Removes a specific variable from the row. If the flag `param1Boolean` is `true`, the variable is also removed from its row.
- `sizeInBytes()`: Returns the size of the row in bytes.
- `use(ArrayRow param1ArrayRow, boolean param1Boolean)`: Sets the row as a linear combination of the given `param1ArrayRow` and the row itself. If `param1Boolean` is `true`, the coefficients are negated.
