The code defines the `NonNull` annotation in the `androidx.annotation` package. This annotation is used to indicate that a method parameter, field, local variable, or annotation type cannot be assigned a null value.

The `NonNull` annotation can be applied to methods, parameters, fields, local variables, annotation types, and packages using the `@Target` annotation.

The `NonNull` annotation is documented, meaning its description and usage documentation can be accessed at runtime.

The `NonNull` annotation has a retention policy of `RetentionPolicy.CLASS`, meaning it is stored in the compiled bytecode but not available at runtime.

The code does not contain any functional logic. It only defines the `NonNull` annotation and its associated target elements.
