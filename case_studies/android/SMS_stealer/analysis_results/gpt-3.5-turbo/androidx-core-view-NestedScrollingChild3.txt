The `NestedScrollingChild3` interface in the `androidx.core.view` package is an extension of the `NestedScrollingChild2` interface. Here's what the code does:

- The interface defines a single method: `dispatchNestedScroll()`.
- The `dispatchNestedScroll()` method is used to notify the parent view that a nested scrolling operation has occurred. It takes in parameters such as the scroll offsets and arrays to store the consumed and unconsumed scroll distances.
- This interface is likely used by views that support nested scrolling, allowing them to communicate with their parent views during scrolling operations.
- The code also includes comments that provide information about the location of the file and the version of the Java compiler and JD-Core used.
