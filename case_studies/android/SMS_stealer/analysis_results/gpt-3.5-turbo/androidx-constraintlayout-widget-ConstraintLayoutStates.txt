The `ConstraintLayoutStates` class is responsible for loading and managing states in a `ConstraintLayout`. It parses an XML file that contains information about the different states of the layout and their associated constraint sets. It allows for dynamically changing the constraints based on the current state of the layout.The `ConstraintLayoutStates` class is responsible for parsing XML attributes related to states in a `ConstraintLayout`. It reads attributes such as `constraint_referenced_ids`, `region_height_less_than`, `region_height_more_than`, `region_width_less_than`, and `region_width_more_than`. It also creates a `ConstraintSet` object based on the `constraint_referenced_ids` attribute to manage the constraints for each state. It has a `match` method to check if the layout dimensions match the constraints defined for a particular state.
