The `OptionalMethod` class is a utility class in the OkHttp library. It is used to handle reflective method invocation, including methods that may not exist on all platforms or versions, hence the `Optional` prefix.

The class encapsulates the method name, the return type, and the parameter types. It provides the capability to discover the method on a class and invoke it if it exists. If the method doesn't exist, it appropriately handles the situation without causing a `NoSuchMethodError` to be thrown.

The class has several methods: 

- The constructor takes in the method's return type, name, and parameter types.
- The `getMethod()` method gets a specific method from a given class, returning null if the method doesn't exist or isn't public, or the return type isn't as specified.
- The `invoke()` method attempts to invoke the specific method, throwing an `InvocationTargetException` if the method doesn't exist and mirroring any exceptions thrown by the method itself.
- The `invokeOptional()` method is similar but returns null if the method doesn't exist or isn't accessible.
- The `invokeWithoutCheckedException()` and `invokeOptionalWithoutCheckedException()` methods are similar to the above but throw an `AssertionError` in place of any checked exceptions.
- The `isSupported()` method checks whether the specified method exists and is public on the given object's class.

This class helps in handling differences between Android and Java platforms, and contributes to the library's resilience and adaptability.
