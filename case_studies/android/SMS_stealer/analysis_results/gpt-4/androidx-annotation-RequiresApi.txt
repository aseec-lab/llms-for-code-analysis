The `@RequiresApi` annotation is used in Android apps to specify that a type (class, interface, etc.), a method, a constructor, a field, or an entire package requires a specific Android API level to function correctly. The 'api()' or 'value()' methods are used to specify this required API level. By default, it is 1 if not provided explicitly. 

Again, `@Retention(RetentionPolicy.CLASS)` informs the compiler it needs to keep the annotation in the compiled class file, and `@Target` is used to declare the annotation targets.

The trailing comment provides metadata used by Java Decompiler (JD-Core) and does not affect the function of `@RequiresApi`.
