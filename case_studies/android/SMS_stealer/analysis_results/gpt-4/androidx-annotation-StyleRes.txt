The `@StyleRes` annotation is used in Android apps to indicate that the integer parameter, method return type, or field refers to a valid Android style resource such as a theme. It's an annotation to ensure type safety in method parameters or return types.

`@Retention(RetentionPolicy.CLASS)`: Specifies this annotation will be recorded in the class file by the compiler but need not be retained by the VM at run time.

`@Target({ElementType.METHOD, ElementType.PARAMETER, ElementType.FIELD, ElementType.LOCAL_VARIABLE})`: Specifies this annotation can be used on methods, method parameters, fields, or local variables.

The comment at the end is metadata used by Java Decompiler (JD-Core) and does not affect the operation of the `@StyleRes` annotation.
