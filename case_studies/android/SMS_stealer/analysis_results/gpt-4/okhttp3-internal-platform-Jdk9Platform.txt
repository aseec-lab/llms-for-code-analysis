The `Jdk9Platform` class extends the `Platform` class and is specifically designed to work with JDK Version 9 and above. Its role is to provide SSL configuration compatibility with newer versions of the JDK.

The constructor takes two `Method` objects representing the `setApplicationProtocols` and `getApplicationProtocol` methods.

The `buildIfSupported()` method tries to build the `Jdk9Platform` object by fetching the two methods mentioned above. If the methods are not found (as may be the case in older JDK versions), it returns null leaving the platform undetermined.

The `configureTlsExtensions()` method is overridden to set the SSL parameters with the protocol names received using the application protocols method fetched via reflection.

The `getSelectedProtocol()` method is also overridden to fetch the currently selected protocol using the reflection-fetched method. If the protocol name is null or an empty string, this method returns null.

The `trustManager()` method throws an `UnsupportedOperationException`. While `trustManager` functionality is often used to set custom trust managers for SSLSocketFactory, it's unsupported in JDK 9+.
