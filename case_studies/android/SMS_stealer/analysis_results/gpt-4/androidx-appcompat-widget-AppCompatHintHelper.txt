The `AppCompatHintHelper` class has a helper method `onCreateInputConnection` that is used to build up an `InputConnection`. In this method, it checks if an existing `InputConnection` and the `EditorInfo`'s hint text are not `null`. If the conditions meet, it will loop through all parent views of the current view until it finds a parent view that implements the `WithHint` interface. Upon finding the view, it will set the interface's hint text to the `EditorInfo` and break the loop. The original `InputConnection` is returned regardless of whether a hint text is found.
