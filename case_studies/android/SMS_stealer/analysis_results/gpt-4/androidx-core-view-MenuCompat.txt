The `MenuCompat` class in the provided code provides compatibility support for handling Android menu components. It has two static methods:

1. `setGroupDividerEnabled(Menu, boolean)`: This method sets whether or not dividers should be shown between menu group items. If the provided menu is an instance of `SupportMenu`, it uses its method to set the flag. Otherwise, if the Android system is version 28 or higher, it uses the Menu object's own method.

2. `setShowAsAction(MenuItem, int)`: This deprecated method sets how an item should be shown as an action item on the toolbar. The usage of this method is now discouraged, and developers are suggested to use the method of MenuItem directly.

Finally, details about the original location of the class file, Java compiler version, and JD-Core version are given in the comments.
