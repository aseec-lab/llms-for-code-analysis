The `FastSafeIterableMap` class extends the `SafeIterableMap` class. It is a type of map data structure which ensures that the ordering of elements remains unchanged even when adding or removing items from it. The key functions of this class are as follows:

1. `ceil(K paramK)`: This method returns the previous key-value pair (`mPrevious`) if the key (`paramK`) exists in the map, else it returns null.

2. `contains(K paramK)`: This method checks whether a key exists in the map or not.

3. `get(K paramK)`: Returns the entry (`SafeIterableMap.Entry`) for the given key in the `mHashMap`.

4. `putIfAbsent(K paramK, V paramV)`: This method adds a new key-value pair to the map if the key doesn't already exist.

5. `remove(K paramK)`: This method removes the key-value pair from the map with the specified key and also from the `mHashMap`.

It uses a `HashMap` called `mHashMap` for storing the key-value pairs, which offers constant time performance for the basic operations (get and put).
