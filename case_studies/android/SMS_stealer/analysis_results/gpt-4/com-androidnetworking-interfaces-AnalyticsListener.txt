The `AnalyticsListener` is an interface in the `com.androidnetworking.interfaces` package. It declares the `onReceived` method:

`void onReceived(long paramLong1, long paramLong2, long paramLong3, boolean paramBoolean);`

This method will be executed whenever certain analytics-related data is received. The parameters, as of now, are not descriptive about the specifics of the data they might hold. However, they could be used for values such as data received time, data size, and other analytic metrics.

Any class implementing `AnalyticsListener` should provide a concrete implementation of this method, defining how it will handle the received analytics data.
