The `PluralsRes` is an annotation used in Android to indicate that a variable, method, parameter or field represents a reference to a plurals resource, typically in Android strings.xml resources. This annotation can be used for extra validation, ensuring that the provided integer is indeed a valid plurals resource ID. The retention policy `RetentionPolicy.CLASS` indicates that the annotation will be stored in the class file during compilation but will not be available in the runtime JVM. This is primarily used for hinting and code checks during development and not enforced at runtime.
