This code defines a `ConnectionShutdownException` class which is a simple subclass of the built-in Java `IOException`. This exception is likely used within the OkHttp library to signify that a connection was unexpectedly shut down. Since it extends `IOException`, it can be used anywhere an `IOException` is expected. The exception doesn't add any additional functionalities or members to the base `IOException` class.
