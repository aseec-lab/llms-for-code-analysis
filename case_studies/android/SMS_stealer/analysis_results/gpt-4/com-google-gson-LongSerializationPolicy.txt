The `LongSerializationPolicy` enum in the `com.google.gson` package appears to be used for defining how `Long` values should be serialized to JSON. 

- The `DEFAULT` policy serializes `Long` values as a `JsonPrimitive`, retaining its numeric nature in the JSON representation.
- The `STRING` policy isn't given an implementation in this excerpt but, by its name, it presumably serializes `Long` values as `String` representations to ensure exact value preservation.

Each enum value must implement the `serialize(Long paramLong)` method, which takes a `Long` value and returns a `JsonElement` representing the serialized form.

Like the previous code, this one also appears to be decompiled from a `.jar` file. The implementation of `STRING` policy and the function of `$VALUES` are missing in the given excerpt.
