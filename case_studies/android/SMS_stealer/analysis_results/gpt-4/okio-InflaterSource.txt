The `InflaterSource` class implements the `Source` interface for reading data into `Buffer`s. It uses a `Inflater` object (for decompression) and a `BufferedSource` from which the data is read.

Key variables:
- `bufferBytesHeldByInflater`: the number of bytes from the buffer that the inflater holds.
- `closed`: whether the source has been closed or not.
- `inflater`: the `Inflater` object used for decompression.
- `source`: the `BufferedSource` from which data is read.

Key methods:
- `InflaterSource()`: constructor, takes in a `BufferedSource` and an `Inflater` and checks if they're not null.
- `releaseInflatedBytes()`: releases bytes that have been inflated. The buffer reduces the number of bytes it holds by the number of bytes remaining in the inflater after inflation.
- `close()`: closes the source if it's not closed yet. Ends the inflater and closes the source.
- `read()`: reads data into a buffer. The data is inflated from the source and written into writable segments of the target buffer until the inflater finishes, needs a dictionary (pre-defined data for inflation), or the source is exhausted.
- `refill()`: refills the data to be decompressed if the inflater needs input. The method releases inflated bytes and sets the inflater's input to a segment of data from the source.
- `timeout()`: returns the source's timeout.

This class is an efficient bridge between `Source` and `Inflater`. It can decompress data on the fly as it reads from the source.
