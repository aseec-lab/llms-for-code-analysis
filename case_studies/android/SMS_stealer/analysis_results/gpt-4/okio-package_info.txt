The file `package_info.java` in the okio package does not contain any actual code. It seems like it's just a placeholder or marker file. It includes an import statement for `ParametersAreNonnullByDefault` annotation from `javax.annotation` package, which is a type qualifier. However, this annotation is not used in this file. The location comment suggests that this file might be part of decompiled Java code. No classes, interfaces, or methods are defined in this file.
