The `ConnectionQuality` enum is a simple way to represent different levels of network connection quality within the Android Networking library. Enum values are:

- `EXCELLENT` represents a very high-quality network connection.
- `GOOD` represents a good-quality network connection.
- `MODERATE` represents an average-quality network connection.
- `POOR` represents a poor or low-quality network connection.
- `UNKNOWN` represents a network connection for which the quality can't be determined.

These values can be used within the library to control how network requests are handled based on the quality of the device's network connection at a given time. For instance, larger downloads might be scheduled for a time when the connection quality is `GOOD` or `EXCELLENT` to minimize the chance of errors or failed downloads.
