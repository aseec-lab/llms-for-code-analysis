The `ParcelField` is an annotation defined in the `androidx.versionedparcelable` package of Android. 

-  It has a `@Retention` policy of `SOURCE`, which means this annotation is only used during compile time and is not included in the APK runtime.
   
-  The `@Target` indicates this annotation can only be used on fields (`ElementType.FIELD`).
   
-  There are two elements to this annotation: 
    - `defaultValue()`, which returns a string that defaults to an empty string.
    - `value()`, which must be set when the annotation is used, and it returns an integer.

This annotation is typically used to indicate and provide metadata for fields that should be parcelled for IPC (Inter Process Communication) or persisting data. Fields annotated with `@ParcelField` are processed by the VersionedParcelable library to generate the `readFromParcel` and `writeToParcel` methods. The `value()` attribute indicates the order of fields as they are written and read from the parcel.
