The `InternalRunnable` class implements the `Runnable` interface and is designed to perform various HTTP operations like GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, DOWNLOAD, UPLOAD, etc.

- It contains properties for an `ANRequest` instance, a `Priority` enum value, and a sequence integer.

- Its constructor accepts an `ANRequest` object and sets the object, its sequence number, and its priority.

- `getPriority()` returns the priority of the request.

- `run()` oversees the execution of HTTP requests according to their type (e.g., simple, download, or upload).

- `executeSimpleRequest()`, `executeDownloadRequest()`, and `executeUploadRequest()` manage the execution of simple, download, and upload requests, respectively. They send the request, handle the response or failures, and pass responses/errors to the main thread.

- `deliverError()` is a helper method that assists in passing errors to the main thread.

In essence, this class is the main workhorse behind sending network requests, receiving responses, and handling response delivery and error handling.
