The `@IntegerRes` is an annotation used in Android applications. AndroidX uses it to denote that an integer parameter, field, or method return value is expected to be an integer resource reference (for example, a unique integer value that might refer to an integer defined in a `values` resource file in an Android application). 

Just like in the `@NavigationRes`, the `@Documented` annotation means it will be included in the JavaDoc. `@Retention(RetentionPolicy.CLASS)` signifies that the annotation will be recorded in the class file by the compiler but need not be retained by the VM at run time. `@Target` is used to indicate where this annotation can be used - methods, parameters, fields, and local variables. 

The following metadata is for Java Decompiler (JD-Core) and it doesn't affect the functionality of this `@IntegerRes` annotation.
