The `PathSegment` class represents a segment of a path between two points with associated fractions. Each `PathSegment` instance contains two `PointF` objects, representing the start and end points of the segment, and two floats, representing the start and end fractions respectively.

- The constructor `PathSegment(PointF paramPointF1, float paramFloat1, PointF paramPointF2, float paramFloat2)` initializes a new `PathSegment` instance with the specified start point, start fraction, end point, and end fraction.

- The `getEnd()`, `getEndFraction()`, `getStart()`, and `getStartFraction()` methods return the respective properties of a `PathSegment` instance.

- The `equals(Object paramObject)` method checks whether a given object is equal to this `PathSegment` instance. Two `PathSegment` instances are considered equal if their start and end points, as well as start and end fractions are equal.

- The `hashCode()` method computes a unique hash code for a `PathSegment` instance, primarily used when `PathSegment` instances are inserted into a `HashMap`, `HashSet` or other data structures that use hash codes.

- The `toString()` method returns a string representation of a `PathSegment` instance, which can be useful for debugging purposes.
