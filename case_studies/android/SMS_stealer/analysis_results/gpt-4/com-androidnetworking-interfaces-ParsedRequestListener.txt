The `ParsedRequestListener` interface represents a listener for network requests that are expected to return a response that is already parsed to a certain type `T`.

This interface is part of the `com.androidnetworking.interfaces` package and declares two methods:

1. `onError(ANError paramANError)`: This method is called when an error occurs during a network request operation. This method takes as a parameter an object of `ANError` type, containing details about the occurred error.

2. `onResponse(T paramT)`: This method is called when a network request is successfully completed. The method receives a response object of type T.

Any class that is implementing the `ParsedRequestListener` interface must provide concrete implementations for these two methods, defining how it will handle both success and error scenarios.
