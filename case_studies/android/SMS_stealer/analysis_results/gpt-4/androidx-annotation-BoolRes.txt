The `BoolRes` annotation in Android is used to denote that the integer parameter, field, local variable, or method return type is expected to represent a Boolean resource reference in your project resources (e.g., a reference to a `<bool>` element in an XML file).

The `@Retention(RetentionPolicy.CLASS)` annotation indicates that this annotation will be recorded in the compiled .class file but will be ignored at runtime. The `@Target` annotation specifies that this annotation can be used with method declarations, parameters, fields, and local variables. The `@Documented` annotation indicates that elements annotated with `BoolRes` should be documented using the Javadoc tool.
