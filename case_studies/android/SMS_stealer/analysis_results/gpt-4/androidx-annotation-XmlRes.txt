The `@XmlRes` annotation is used to indicate the source of XML resources, typically in Android development. These resources could be anything from layouts, animations, to drawables, etc. 

- `@Documented`: This is a marker interface that indicates this annotation should be included in the class or method's documentation.

- `@Retention(RetentionPolicy.CLASS)`: This annotation is to be recorded in the class file by the compiler but need not be retained by the VM at run time.

- `@Target`: This is used to mark the program elements (method, field, local variable, parameters) that can be annotated with `@XmlRes`.

The comment at the end of the code is metadata used often in Java Decompiler (JD-Core). This data does not affect how the `@XmlRes` annotation works.
