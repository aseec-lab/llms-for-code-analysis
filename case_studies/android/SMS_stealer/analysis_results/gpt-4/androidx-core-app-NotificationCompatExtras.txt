This class, `NotificationCompatExtras`, is a simple utility class part of the `androidx.core.app` package. It provides several static final strings, each representing a different key for extras that can be included in an Android notification.

The keys include:
1. `EXTRA_ACTION_EXTRAS` for action extras inside the notification.
2. `EXTRA_GROUP_KEY` for identifying the group key associated with the notification.
3. `EXTRA_GROUP_SUMMARY` for identifying whether the notification is a group summary.
4. `EXTRA_LOCAL_ONLY` for indicating whether the notification should only be displayed on the local device.
5. `EXTRA_REMOTE_INPUTS` for specifying any remote inputs associated with the notification.
6. `EXTRA_SORT_KEY` for specifying the sort key for the notification.

The values assigned to these keys are likely used by the system or other parts of the application for proper handling of notifications. As this class only provides keys and doesn't implement any functionality, it's likely used in conjunction with other notification-related classes in Android.
