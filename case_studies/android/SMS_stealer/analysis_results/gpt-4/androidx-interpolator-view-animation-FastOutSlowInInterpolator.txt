This code defines a class called `FastOutSlowInInterpolator` which extends the `LookupTableInterpolator` class. 

The `FastOutSlowInInterpolator` class initializes a static array `VALUES` holding a series of float values representing a fast acceleration (out) and a slow deceleration (in) interpolation.

The constructor for the `FastOutSlowInInterpolator` calls the parent `LookupTableInterpolator` constructor, passing in the `VALUES` array. 

The `FastOutSlowInInterpolator` is a type of easing function, where animations start quickly and end slowly, making transitions appear smooth and avoid abrupt changes, which can be useful for creating natural and organic animations in an AndroidX-based project.
