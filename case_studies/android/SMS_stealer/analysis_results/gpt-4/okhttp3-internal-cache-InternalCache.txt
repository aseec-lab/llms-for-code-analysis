The `InternalCache` interface in OkHttp is used to represent a caching mechanism for HTTP requests/responses. The main methods are:

1. `get(Request paramRequest)`: This retrieves a cached `Response` for the provided `Request`, if one exists.

2. `put(Response paramResponse)`: This stores a `Response` in the cache. It returns a `CacheRequest` which is used to write the body of that response. 

3. `remove(Request paramRequest)`: This removes any cached response for the provided `Request`.

4. `trackConditionalCacheHit()`: This is invoked when a cache validation succeeds and the existing cache will be used without having to re-fetch from the server.

5. `trackResponse(CacheStrategy paramCacheStrategy)`: This tracks the caching strategy used for a response. It will help track how many responses were served from cache, how many were validated, and how many needed to be fetched afresh.

6. `update(Response paramResponse1, Response paramResponse2)`: This updates the cached values for a `Response` with the values from another `Response`. This is typically used after validating a cached response with a server. The original cache response is `paramResponse1`, and the network response used to update it is `paramResponse2`. 

The interface allows for flexible implementations of caching behavior.
