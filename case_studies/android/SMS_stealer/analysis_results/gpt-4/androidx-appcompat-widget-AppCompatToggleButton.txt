The `AppCompatToggleButton` class extends the `ToggleButton` class and is used for compatibility purposes, to have consistent behavior across different Android versions.

1. The class constructor comes in three overloaded forms: The simplest constructor taking only the `Context` element if no attributes or style is provided, the other taking `AttributeSet`, useful when the `ToggleButton` is created in your XML layout file, and the last also takes an additional style parameter for further customization.

2. The `ThemeUtils.checkAppCompatTheme()` method is used to check if the current theme of the application is compatible with the Material Design guidelines.

3. An `AppCompatTextHelper` object is created and tied to the ToggleButton, which will help to load and manage text-related attributes given in the AttributeSet while creating the `ToggleButton`.

4. The `loadFromAttributes()` method of the `AppCompatTextHelper` class is used to read and apply the various text-related attributes to the `ToggleButton`.

In summary, the class is meant to offer a more flexible ToggleButton that can be styled and themed better across different Android versions while sticking to Material Design guidelines.
