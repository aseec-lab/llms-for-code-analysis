The `Version` class is a simple utility class within the OkHttp3 internal package. It has one public static method called `userAgent()` that returns a string representing the current OkHttp version, which is "okhttp/3.10.0" in this case. The purpose of this method is likely to provide a version identifier for the User-Agent header in HTTP requests generated by the OkHttp library.
