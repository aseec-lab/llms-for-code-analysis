The `ObjectConstructor` is an interface in the Gson library under the `com.google.gson.internal` package. It has a single method, `construct`, that doesn't take any arguments and is supposed to return an instance of a generic type `T`. The exact behavior of the `construct` method is defined by classes that implement this interface.

This interface is intended to serve as a factory for creating object instances, typically of type `T`. The classes that implement this interface will provide concrete implementations of how these objects should be constructed.

Annotational comments at the end suggest that this code has been decompiled and possibly came from a jar file.
