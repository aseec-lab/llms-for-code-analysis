The `BitmapRequestListener` is an interface in the `com.androidnetworking.interfaces` package. It declares two methods: `onError` and `onResponse`. 

- `void onError(ANError paramANError);` : This method will be called when there's an error in the networking request related to bitmap image. The `ANError` parameter contains the details of the error.

- `void onResponse(Bitmap paramBitmap);` : This method will be called when the networking request related to Bitmap image is successful. The returned Bitmap image is passed as a parameter.

Any class implementing `BitmapRequestListener` should provide concrete implementation for these methods. The action on a successful response and the action on an error condition should be defined specifically.
