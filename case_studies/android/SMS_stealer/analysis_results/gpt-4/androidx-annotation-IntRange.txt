The `IntRange` annotation is used in Android to ensure an integer is within a specific range, defined by `from` and `to` values. This annotation can annotate a method, parameter, field, or a local variable, and it's primarily used to provide additional information about the acceptable values during development. The default range values are the minimum and maximum values of `long` primitive type and the `RetentionPolicy` as well as `@Target` annotation usage is the same as in other Android annotation types.

In essence, `IntRange` helps prevent errors associated with values that are outside of the allowed range. None of these conditions are enforced at runtime; it's more of a guideline or contract specified during development.
