The `StreamResetException` class extends the `IOException` class. It is used to represent an exception that is thrown when a stream is reset. An instance of `StreamResetException` includes an `ErrorCode` that signifies the type of error that caused the stream to be reset. The `StreamResetException` class has a constructor that takes an `ErrorCode` as a parameter, the `ErrorCode` value is then stored in the final `errorCode` variable for the instance. The `toString()` method of the `ErrorCode` object is called and its string value is passed to the parent class `IOException` via `super` keyword. 

And this class seems to be a part of the OkHttp library, a popular HTTP client for Java applications. It is primarily used in HTTP/2 connections to handle exceptions that occur during streaming data.
