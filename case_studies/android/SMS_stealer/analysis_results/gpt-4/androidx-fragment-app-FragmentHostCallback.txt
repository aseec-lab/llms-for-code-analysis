The `FragmentHostCallback` is an abstract class that extends the `FragmentContainer`. It acts as the callback interface between fragments and the activity hosting them.

1. It contains references to the `Activity`, `Context` and `Fragment Manager`, as well as a `Handler` for managing threads and a `WindowAnimations` int for managing window animations.

2. It provides important methods such as `getActivity()`, `getContext()`, `getHandler()` for returning the respective class instances.

3. Some methods are abstract like `onGetHost()`, which must be overridden by any class that extends `FragmentHostCallback`.

4. Some other methods like `onAttachFragment()`, `onRequestPermissionsFromFragment()`, `onStartActivityFromFragment()`, and `onStartIntentSenderFromFragment()` are provided for handling specific interactions with fragments but their implementations are either empty or basic, suggesting that they're intended to be overridden by subclasses for more specific behavior.

5. Lastly, it has methods that support fragment lifecycle such as `onFindViewById()`, `onGetLayoutInflater()`, `onHasView()`, `onHasWindowAnimations()` and `onShouldSaveFragmentState()`.

In general, this class handles interactions between an activity and its hosted fragments, providing basic behavior while also allowing for customization through its abstract and non-final methods.
