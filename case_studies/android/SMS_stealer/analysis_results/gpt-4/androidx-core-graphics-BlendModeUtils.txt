This code file, 'BlendModeUtils.java', in the 'androidx.core.graphics' package, defines utility methods for obtaining blend modes. 

The method 'obtainBlendModeFromCompat' takes as input an instance of 'BlendModeCompat' and returns a corresponding 'BlendMode'. If the input doesn't match any known compatibility blend modes, it returns 'BlendMode.CLEAR'.

The method 'obtainPorterDuffFromCompat' takes as input an instance of 'BlendModeCompat' and returns a corresponding 'PorterDuff.Mode'. If the input is null or if it doesn't match any known compatibility blend modes, the method returns null. 

These utility methods are likely used to convert blend modes specified in the app's compatibility layer into blend modes that can be used with the underlying Android system's graphics utilities.
