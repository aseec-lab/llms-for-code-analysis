The `ShareActionProvider` class is a custom ActionProvider extending from the `ActionProvider` class in the Android framework. This class provides an optimized, flexible, and easy way to add a standard share action to an application.

This class contains inner interfaces `OnShareTargetSelectedListener`, and inner classes `ShareActivityChooserModelPolicy` and `ShareMenuItemOnMenuItemClickListener`. These are used to handle events when an item from the share list is selected.

The `ShareActionProvider` class has a constructor that receives a `Context` as a parameter. 

The `setShareHistoryFileName` method allows you to specify a custom share history file.

The `setShareIntent` method is used to set an intent that will be used to share content.

The `onCreateActionView` method creates a new action view for the action provider and sets an activity chooser model so that users can choose an app for sharing.

The `onPrepareSubMenu` method populates a sub-menu with all the available sharing options.

The `updateIntent` adds flags to the intent depending on the build version of the android device.

The `setOnShareTargetSelectedListener` method allows setting a listener which will receive a callback when a user selects an item from the list of sharing applications.
