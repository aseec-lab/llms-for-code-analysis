The `PackageInfoCompat` class in the `androidx.core.content.pm` package has a static method `getLongVersionCode(PackageInfo)`. This method returns the long version code of the provided `PackageInfo` instance.

The code checks whether the Android SDK version is 28 or higher. If it is, it leverages `getLongVersionCode()` method available in the `PackageInfo` class for Android versions 28 and above to get the long version code. If the Android version is less than 28, it falls back to using `versionCode` field, which is deprecated in API 28.

This class helps maintain backward compatibility with older Android versions while accessing an app's version code.
