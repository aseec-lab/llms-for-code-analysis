The `State` class primarily handles the states and operations of widgets and helpers within a Constraint Widget Container. It uses references and helper references to manage widget instances and apply their constraints. The class contains methods to apply constraints, create and handle helper references like barriers, chains, guidelines, and adjust properties like width and height of the widgets. It maintains `HashMaps` to keep track of references (widgets) and helper references.

It also includes nested enumerations to define the various Constraints, Directions, Chains, and Helpers used within the `State` class. The `Constraint` enum defines different types of constraints like LEFT_TO_LEFT, TOP_TO_TOP, etc. The `Direction` enum includes LEFT, RIGHT, TOP, BOTTOM, START, END. The `Chain` defines the types of chains as SPREAD, SPREAD_INSIDE, PACKED, and the `Helper` enum defines helper classes like HORIZONTAL_CHAIN, ALIGN_HORIZONTALLY, BARRIER, FLOW, etc.
