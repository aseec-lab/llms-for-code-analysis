The `AnimatorRes` annotation is used in Android to designate that a particular variable, method, parameter, or field corresponds to a reference for an animation resource. Like `PluralsRes`, this annotation is retained at compile time for validation purposes, indicated by the `RetentionPolicy.CLASS`. It can be applied to methods, parameters, fields, and local variables as pointed out in the `@Target` annotation.
