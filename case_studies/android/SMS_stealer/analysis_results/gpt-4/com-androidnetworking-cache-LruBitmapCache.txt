The `LruBitmapCache` class is a cache for storing Bitmap objects with string keys. It implements the `ANImageLoader.ImageCache` interface and extends the `LruCache` class, which is a cache with a Least Recently Used policy.

This class provides the following functionalities:

- In the constructor `LruBitmapCache(int paramInt)`, it calls the superclass' constructor, passing along a size limit for the cache.

- There are methods to manipulate the cache, such as `putBitmap(String paramString, Bitmap paramBitmap)` for adding an entry to the cache, `getBitmap(String paramString)` for retrieving an entry from the cache, and `evictBitmap(String paramString)` and `evictAllBitmap()` for removing entries from the cache.

- The `sizeOf(String paramString, Bitmap paramBitmap)` method calculates the size of a Bitmap in memory, helpful for properly controlling the cache size.

Thanks to this class, Bitmaps can be efficiently cached and retrieved, saving memory by only keeping the most recently used items.
