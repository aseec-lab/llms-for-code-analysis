The `PaintCompat` class provides compatibility methods for the `android.graphics.Paint` class in Android. 

1. `hasGlyph(Paint paramPaint, String paramString)`: Checks whether a specific glyph is available in a Paint's typeface. It uses different strategies for the checking based on the Android API level. 

2. `obtainEmptyRects()`: This method obtains two empty Rect objects, stored as a pair in a `ThreadLocal` variable. If the thread-local variable is not set, it initializes it with two new Rect instances. 

3. `setBlendMode(Paint paramPaint, BlendModeCompat paramBlendModeCompat)`: This method sets a BlendMode on a Paint object. The BlendMode determines how new colors are combined with existing colors in the drawing. The method works differently depending on the Android version.

In summary, this class provides functionalities to handle graphical painting and rendering compatibly across different Android versions.
