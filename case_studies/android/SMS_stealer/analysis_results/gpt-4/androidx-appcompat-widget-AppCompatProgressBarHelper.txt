The `AppCompatProgressBarHelper` class is a helper class used to support additional functionality for the `ProgressBar` widget in the AndroidX AppCompat library.

It can be used to modify the appearance of the `ProgressBar` in terms of drawables that are used to represent progress. This class allows you to create a tile effect for progress bars, which provides a more aesthetic and visually appealing progress indication.

- `getDrawableShape()`: Returns a round rectangular `Shape` that can be used as a base shape for creating a drawable.

- `tileify(Drawable paramDrawable, boolean paramBoolean)`: Converts a given `Drawable` into another one that can repeat/ tile itself throughout the ProgressBar.

- `tileifyIndeterminate(Drawable paramDrawable)`: Method used to transform the indeterminate drawable of a ProgressBar into a tile-able drawable.

- `getSampleTile()`: Returns current drawable used as a sample tile bitmap.

- `loadFromAttributes(AttributeSet paramAttributeSet, int paramInt)`: Loads custom attribute values from a given `AttributeSet`, then modifies the ProgressBar's appearance based on these.
