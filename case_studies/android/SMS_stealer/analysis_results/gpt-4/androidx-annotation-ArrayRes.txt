`ArrayRes` is an annotation from the AndroidX library. It's used to indicate that an `int` parameter, field, method return value or local variable is expected to be an Array resource reference (e.g., `R.array.some_array`). 

The annotation helps ensure that valid array resource references are provided where required, helping to maintain code integrity and prevent possible bugs and crashes.

The `@Retention(RetentionPolicy.CLASS)` annotation tells the Java compiler to keep the annotation in the compiled class file, but remove it at runtime. 

The `@Target` annotation means that this annotation can be used on methods, parameters, fields, and local variables.

The footer note suggests this file was decompiled from a jar file (dex2jar.jar), likely originally written in Java 6, then decompiled using JD-Core version 1.1.3.
