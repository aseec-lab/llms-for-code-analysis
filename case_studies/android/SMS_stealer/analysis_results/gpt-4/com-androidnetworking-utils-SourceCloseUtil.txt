The `SourceCloseUtil` class is a utility class in the package `com.androidnetworking.utils`. 

It has a single public static method `close(Response paramResponse, ANRequest paramANRequest)`. 

This method checks if the `ResponseType` of the given `ANRequest` object is not `OK_HTTP_RESPONSE`. It also verifies the `Response` object and its body & source are not null.

If all these conditions pass, it then attempts to close the source of the response body. 

Any exception that occurs while trying to close the source is ignored, i.e., it's safely closed without throwing an exception. 

In summary, this utility class is used to safely close the source of the OKHttp Response body.
