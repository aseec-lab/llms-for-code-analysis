The `Protocol` class in the OkHttp3 library is an `enum` that represents the communication protocols used to transmit data across the internet. 

It defines five constants: 
1. `HTTP_1_0`: Representing the HTTP/1.0 protocol
2. `HTTP_1_1`: Representing the HTTP/1.1 protocol
3. `HTTP_2`: Representing the HTTP/2 protocol
4. `QUIC`: Representing the QUIC protocol
5. `SPDY_3`: Representing the SPDY/3.1 protocol

Each constant is associated with a string that represents the protocol.

The class provides a static method `get(String paramString)` for looking up a `Protocol` constant by its string. If the input string doesn't match any predefined protocol, it throws an `IOException`.

The `toString()` method is overridden to return the string representation of the protocol.
