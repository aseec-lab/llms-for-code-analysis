This code defines a class called `LinearOutSlowInInterpolator` which extends the `LookupTableInterpolator` class. 

The `LinearOutSlowInInterpolator` class has a pre-defined static array of float values called `VALUES`. This array represents values defining an interpolation motion which starts fast and slows down toward the end. 

In the `LinearOutSlowInInterpolator` constructor, these pre-defined values are passed to the parent class (`LookupTableInterpolator`) using the `super` keyword. 

This class is commonly used in animations where you want your animations to decelerate slowly. The rate of change is fast in the beginning and slows down at the end. The user may perceive this as the animation settling into place.

The file path comment at the end indicates that this class file is part of the AndroidX Interpolator library, which provides several interpolator classes for fine grained control over animation behaviour.
