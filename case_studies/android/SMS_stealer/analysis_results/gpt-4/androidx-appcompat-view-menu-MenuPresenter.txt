The `MenuPresenter` is an interface that represents the mechanism to show a `Menu` to the user.

Key methods defined in this interface include:
- `collapseItemActionView` and `expandItemActionView` for collapsing and expanding an action view associated with a menu item respectively.
- `flagActionItems` for marking certain menu items as action items.
- `getId` and `setId` for getting and setting the ID of the menu.
- `getMenuView` for obtaining the view associated with the menu.
- `initForMenu` for initializing the presenter for a given menu.
- `onCloseMenu` and `onSubMenuSelected` for responding to menu closing and submenu selection events respectively.
- `onRestoreInstanceState` and `onSaveInstanceState` for managing the presenter's status when the activity's state is saved or restored.
- `setCallback` for setting a callback to be invoked when a menu event occurs.
- `updateMenuView` for refreshing the UI of the menu.

The `Callback` interface is a listener for menu events. It has two methods:
- `onCloseMenu`: Invoked when a menu is closed.
- `onOpenSubMenu`: Invoked when a submenu is opened.

When a class implements this interface, it needs to define how these methods should operate.
