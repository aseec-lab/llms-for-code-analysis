The `ActivityOptionsCompat` class is a compatibility class for `android.app.ActivityOptions` used for customizing activity transition animations. It allows you to specify how the transition animation should be performed when an Activity is launched.

Various static factory methods are provided to create an instance of this class:
1. `makeBasic()`: It creates the basic options which don't perform special animation.
2. `makeClipRevealAnimation()`: It creates an activity options passing an animation where a view is revealed or concealed by a circular clip mask.
3. `makeCustomAnimation()`: It creates activity options specifying custom animation resources to run when transitioning to another activity.
4. `makeScaleUpAnimation()`: It creates an activity option to start a new activity with an animation where it scales from a small originating area of the screen.
5. `makeSceneTransitionAnimation()`: It creates activities options for a cross-activity scene transition.
6. `makeTaskLaunchBehind()`: It creates activity options for launching a new task.
7. `makeThumbnailScaleUpAnimation()`: It creates activity options for a new activity launching, scaling up its containing window.

There is an inner class `ActivityOptionsCompatImpl` which extends `ActivityOptionsCompat`. It contains a private final variable of `ActivityOptions` and provides definitions to methods like `getLaunchBounds()`, `requestUsageTimeReport()`, `setLaunchBounds()`, `toBundle()`, `update()`, as per the Android API level, and uses this variable for performing the actions.

The two constants `EXTRA_USAGE_TIME_REPORT` and `EXTRA_USAGE_TIME_REPORT_PACKAGES` are used for usage time reporting.
