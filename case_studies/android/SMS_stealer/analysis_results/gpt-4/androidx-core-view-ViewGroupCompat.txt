The `ViewGroupCompat` class in AndroidX provides static methods that control the behavior of `ViewGroup` objects for different SDK versions.

- `getLayoutMode(ViewGroup)`: This method retrieves the layout mode from the `ViewGroup` argument depending on the SDK version used.

- `getNestedScrollAxes(ViewGroup)`: This method returns the current axes of nested scroll for a `ViewGroup` instance.

- `isTransitionGroup(ViewGroup)`: This method checks if a `ViewGroup` is a transition group (used for shared element transitions).

- `onRequestSendAccessibilityEvent(ViewGroup, View, AccessibilityEvent)`: This deprecated method sends an accessibility event from a `ViewGroup`. 

- `setLayoutMode(ViewGroup, int)`: This method sets the layout mode for a `ViewGroup`, adjusting for SDK version.

- `setMotionEventSplittingEnabled(ViewGroup, boolean)`: This deprecated method enables or disables the splitting of MotionEvents into multiple events for pre-scaling and rotation.

- `setTransitionGroup(ViewGroup, boolean)`: This method defines whether the `ViewGroup` is a transition group or not, enabling/disabling shared element transitions.

The class provides backward compatibility for these `ViewGroup` behaviors across different Android versions.
