The `CollapsibleActionView` interface provided by the AndroidX AppCompat library defines two methods: `onActionViewCollapsed()` and `onActionViewExpanded()`. This interface is used to manage the expanded and collapsed states of action views, typically menu items in the app bar (or action bar) of an Android application.

Please note that this interface is marked as `@Deprecated`, meaning it's no longer recommended for use in new code and might be removed in future versions of the library.

Also, the last part of the content is related to metadata and not the functional part of the code.
