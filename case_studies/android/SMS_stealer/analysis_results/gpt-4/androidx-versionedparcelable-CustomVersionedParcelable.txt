`CustomVersionedParcelable` is an abstract class implementing the `VersionedParcelable` interface in the `androidx.versionedparcelable` package. It has two methods:

- `void onPostParceling()`: An empty method used as a hook after the parceling process is done.

- `void onPreParceling(boolean paramBoolean)`: Another empty hook method which gets called before the object is parcelled. The boolean param is typically used to see if it's running on a local binder transport in other implementations.

Being an abstract class implies that it's intended to be subclassed. The subclasses should provide implementations for these methods to customize the parceling process as needed. 

Note: The Location JD version comments implies this code was decompiled from a downloaded jar file.
