`@AnyRes` is a marker annotation used in the AndroidX library to denote that a parameter, method, field, or local variable can represent any resource type (for example, string, drawable, id). This approach can be used when you donâ€™t care about the particular resource type.

The annotation is marked with `@Retention(RetentionPolicy.CLASS)`, meaning that this annotation should be recorded in the class file by the compiler, but not necessarily retained by the Virtual Machine at runtime.

Additionally, it has the `@Target({ElementType.METHOD, ElementType.PARAMETER, ElementType.FIELD, ElementType.LOCAL_VARIABLE})` annotation, which means this annotation can be applied to a method, parameter, field, or local variable.

The presence of `@Documented` indicates that this annotation should be included in the documentation, making it a part of the public API when the class is being documented using a tool like `javadoc`.

The presence of this annotation does not change the behavior of the code; it's used for documentation and tooling support.
