The `SynchronousCall` class in the `com.androidnetworking.internal` package appears to be responsible for performing different types of network requests - simple requests, download requests, and upload requests - and handling their responses.

- The `execute(ANRequest paramANRequest)` method is a general method for executing network requests. Depending on the type of the request, it delegates to the specific methods `executeSimpleRequest(paramANRequest)`,  `executeDownloadRequest(paramANRequest)` or `executeUploadRequest(paramANRequest)` respectively.

- In the `executeSimpleRequest(paramANRequest)`, `executeDownloadRequest(paramANRequest)` and `executeUploadRequest(paramANRequest)` methods, a request is performed and the response is handled. If a response is successful (HTTP status code less than 400), it is parsed and returned. If the response indicates an error (HTTP status code 400 or more), an appropriate error object is created and returned. If no response is obtained or an exception occurs when performing the request, another appropriate error object is created and returned. 

- Error handling and closing of the response source appear to be managed via utility methods `Utils.getErrorForConnection(aNError)` and `SourceCloseUtil.close(response, paramANRequest)`.

It looks like `ANRequest` and `ANResponse` are custom classes representing network requests and responses, while `ANError` is a custom class representing errors occurring during the network interactions. In addition, the library OkHttp seems to be used for performing the network requests.
