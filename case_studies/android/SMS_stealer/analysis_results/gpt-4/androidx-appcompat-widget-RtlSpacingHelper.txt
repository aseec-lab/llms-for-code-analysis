The `RtlSpacingHelper` class aids in setting padding and margins considering the direction of language read. This is especially useful for languages that are read from right-to-left (such as Arabic), hence the name `RtlSpacingHelper`.

- The default value for properties is `Integer.MIN_VALUE` which is equivalent to `UNDEFINED`. 
- `mLeft`, `mRight`, `mExplicitLeft`, `mExplicitRight`, `mStart`, `mEnd` are spacing parameters adjusted based on text direction.
- `mIsRtl` is a flag indicating if the current language is read from Right-to-Left.
- `mIsRelative` is a flag indicating if the spacing is relative (depends on other parameters).
- `getEnd()`, `getLeft()`, `getRight()`, `getStart()` methods return the respective spacing parameters based on the text direction.
- `setAbsolute(int paramInt1, int paramInt2)` allows setting absolute left and right spacing regardless of text direction.
- `setDirection(boolean paramBoolean)` adjusts the spacing parameters based on a provided direction (`true` for right-to-left language, `false` for left-to-right).
- `setRelative(int paramInt1, int paramInt2)` sets the start and end spacing parameters relatively. The actual left and right spacings are then adjusted based on the text direction.
  
In summary, this class manages and adjusts layout margins/padding to support both left-to-right and right-to-left languages.
