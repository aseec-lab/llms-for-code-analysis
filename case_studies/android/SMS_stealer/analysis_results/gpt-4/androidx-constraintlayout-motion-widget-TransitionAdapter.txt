The `TransitionAdapter` is an abstract class that `implements` the `MotionLayout.TransitionListener` interface. This interface is typically used to monitor changes in transition states in a `MotionLayout`.

It has four methods: 

1. `onTransitionChange`: This is intended to be called when the transition changes in the `MotionLayout`.

2. `onTransitionCompleted`: This method should be called when a transition in the `MotionLayout` completes.

3. `onTransitionStarted`: This is meant to be called when a transition in the `MotionLayout` starts.

4. `onTransitionTrigger`: This should be called when a transition in the `MotionLayout` is triggered.

In this abstract class, none of these methods have implementations, meaning that any class extending `TransitionAdapter` would need to provide its own implementation for these methods.
