The `PointerIconCompat` class provides a compatibility layer for creating, loading and managing `PointerIcon` objects on different versions of Android. A `PointerIcon` in Android represents a pointer icon that can be used with a mouse, stylus, or touch input.

Key features:

1. It has defined integer constants for different types of pointer icons used in Android like arrow, crosshair, text, vertical text, grab, hand etc.

2. `create(Bitmap paramBitmap, float paramFloat1, float paramFloat2)`: This method creates a `PointerIconCompat` object from a bitmap image. The icon hotspot will be located at `(paramFloat1, paramFloat2)`.

3. `getSystemIcon(Context paramContext, int paramInt)`: This method obtains a system `PointerIconCompat` of specified type.

4. `load(Resources paramResources, int paramInt)`: This method loads a `PointerIconCompat` from a resource with the provided id.

5. `getPointerIcon()`: This method returns the `PointerIcon` object wrapped within `PointerIconCompat`.

This class provides a way to handle pointer icons in a manner that is compatible with different Android versions.
