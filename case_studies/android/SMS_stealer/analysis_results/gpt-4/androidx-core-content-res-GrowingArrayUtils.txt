The `GrowingArrayUtils` class contains utility methods for managing arrays of various types including integers, longs, generic types, and booleans.

- The `append()` methods add a new element to the end of an array. If the array is already at full capacity, a new larger array is created and the old array copied into it before adding the new element.

- The `growSize()` method returns an increased capacity for the array. It returns a size of 8 if the current size is less than or equal to 4; otherwise, it doubles the current size.

- The `insert()` methods insert a new element at a particular position in an array. If the array is already full, a new larger array is created, the old array copied into it till the index of insertion, the new element added at the index and the rest of the old array copied in after this index.
  
The purpose of this class is to provide dynamic array functionality where the size of the array adjusts as needed when adding or inserting elements.
