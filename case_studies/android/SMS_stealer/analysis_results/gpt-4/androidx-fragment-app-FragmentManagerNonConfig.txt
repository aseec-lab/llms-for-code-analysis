The `FragmentManagerNonConfig` class is a deprecated part of the AndroidX Fragment library. It is used to manage configurations not saved in the default Android framework's state save/restore process for Fragments. The main elements this class manages are the child fragments, fragments, and ViewModelStores.

In this class:
- `mChildNonConfigs` is a Map storing child fragments configurations.
- `mFragments` is a Collection storing additional fragment instances.
- `mViewModelStores` is a Map of ViewModelStore which are used to maintain ViewModel instances across configuration changes.

The constructor `FragmentManagerNonConfig` is used to initialize these three attributes.

The class provides getter methods (`getChildNonConfigs`, `getFragments`, `getViewModelStores`) for these collections and also a method `isRetaining` to check if a specific fragment instance is present in the `mFragments` collection.

It's important to note this class is deprecated, which suggests there are newer ways to handle these concerns.
