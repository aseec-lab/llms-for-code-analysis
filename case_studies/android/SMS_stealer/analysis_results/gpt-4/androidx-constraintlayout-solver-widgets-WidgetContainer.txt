The class `WidgetContainer` extends from the `ConstraintWidget` in ConstraintLayout library and acts as a parent container for other widgets.

- `mChildren` is a list of ConstraintWidgets which could be seen as child widgets of this WidgetContainer.

- `add(ConstraintWidget paramConstraintWidget)` is used to add a child widget into this container and set this container as the parent of the added widget.

- `add(ConstraintWidget... paramVarArgs)` is used to add multiple widgets into this container.

- `getChildren()` returns the child widgets in the container.

- `getRootConstraintContainer()`: If the widget container itself is not a `ConstraintWidgetContainer` then this method traverses back to the parent until it finds the `ConstraintWidgetContainer`.

- `layout()`: It calls the layout method for each child container widget.

- `remove(ConstraintWidget paramConstraintWidget)`: This method removes a specific widget from the container and resets that widget.

- `removeAllChildren()`: Removes all child widgets from the container.

- `reset()`: Clears all the child widgets and calls the reset method from its parent class.

- `resetSolverVariables(Cache paramCache)`: Reset the solver variables in accordance with the Cache for itself and all child widgets.

- `setOffset(int paramInt1, int paramInt2)`: Sets the offset for the widget container and all its child widgets.

The commented part at the end seems to be some meta information about the location of this file, the Java compiler version used and the JD-Core version.
