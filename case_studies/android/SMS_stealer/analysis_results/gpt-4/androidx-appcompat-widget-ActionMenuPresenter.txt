The `ActionMenuPresenter` class extends `BaseMenuPresenter` and implements the `ActionProvider.SubUiVisibilityListener`. It's designed to manage the presentation of actions in the action menu presented in the ActionBar.

The `ActionMenuPresenter` constructor sets up the state of the presenter using the parent application's context.

The `findViewForItem` method returns the corresponding view for a specific `MenuItem`.

The `bindItemView` method associate specific view to a menu item in the action menu.

The `filterLeftoverView` method is used for determining what views to remove when there are more items than can be shown on the action menu.

The `flagActionItems` method runs through all the menu items and determines which ones will be displayed on the action menu.

The `getItemView` method is used to ensure that the associated view of each menu item is correctly initialized and measured. 

This class maintains control and visibility states of menu items and the overflow action button, accommodating dynamic changes and user interactions. It helps in providing a seamless user experience by managing action item behaviors.The `initForMenu` method initializes the `ActionMenuPresenter` for a specific menu. It sets the width limit, resource overflow, and maximum number of items based on the `ActionBarPolicy` for the given context. If the overflow is reserved, it creates an `OverflowMenuButton`.

The `isOverflowMenuShowPending` method determines whether the overflow menu is pending to be shown.

The `onConfigurationChanged` method sets the maximum number of items based on the `ActionBarPolicy` when the configuration changes. If the menu is not null, it updates the items in the menu.The `onRestoreInstanceState` method attempts to find the sub-menu item that was previously opened. If it finds the item, it opens the sub-menu.

The `onSaveInstanceState` method saves the id of the currently opened sub-menu.

The `onSubMenuSelected` method checks if the selected sub-menu has any visible items. If yes, it creates and shows a `ActionButtonSubmenu`.

The `onSubUiVisibilityChanged` method either opens a sub-menu (if `paramBoolean` is true) or closes the menu (otherwise).

The `OpenOverflowRunnable` private class is used to open the overflow menu.

The `OverflowMenuButton` private class, extended from `AppCompatImageView` and implementing `ActionMenuView.ActionMenuChildView`, represents the overflow menu button and handles its click events. For instance, it shows the overflow menu on click.The `onForwardingStopped` method attempts to stop forwarding and hides the overflow menu if no `PostedOpenRunnable` is present.

The `Creator` interface is used to create new instances of the `SavedState` class from a parcel, or an array of `SavedState`.
