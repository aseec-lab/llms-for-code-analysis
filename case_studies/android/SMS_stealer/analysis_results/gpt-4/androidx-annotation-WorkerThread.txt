The WorkerThread annotation is part of the androidx.annotation package of the Android Jetpack library. Its purpose is to indicate that the method should be called on a background thread because it might perform long-running operations such as IO or computation that could block the UI thread. 

The annotation can target methods, constructors, types, and parameters. It is also documented and retained at the bytecode level only, meaning it's not kept in the compiled .class file or available at runtime.

However, this annotation doesn't enforce anything on its own and only serves as an indicator or hint for the developer and/or tools. So, any misuse might not be caught at compile-time or runtime. Code analysis tools, such as lint, may use this annotation to detect or warn about potential problems.
