This file defines an interface named `OnBackPressedDispatcherOwner` which extends `LifecycleOwner` from the androidx.lifecycle package. The interface declares a single method `getOnBackPressedDispatcher()`, which doesn't take any parameters. The type of the return value is `OnBackPressedDispatcher` which is not defined in this file.

The purpose of this interface is to provide a standardized way for objects to provide an `OnBackPressedDispatcher`, which typically controls what to do when the back button is pressed in a user interface like an Android app. Any class that implements this interface is therefore expected to provide an instance of `OnBackPressedDispatcher` so that other classes can interact with it. 

The additional text on the bottom, as in the previous file, are metadata related to the file location, Java compiler version, and JD-Core Version, and doesn't influence the behavior of the code.
