The `PopupMenuCompat` class provides compatibility for the `PopupMenu` API for older versions of Android. It contains only one method: 

- `getDragToOpenListener()`: This method retrieves and returns the object that is used as the touch listener for dragging to open the popup menu. The method has a conditional return, if the device is running Android 4.4 (KitKat) or higher, it calls `getDragToOpenListener()` method from `PopupMenu`, otherwise, it returns `null`. This is a way to handle compatibility with Android versions that do not support this method natively.
