This `Optimizer` class seems to be part of a system used for solving constraints in a ConstraintWidget layout system, which may be part of a user interface toolkit or layout engine. Here are the functionalities of the methods:

- `checkMatchParent(ConstraintWidgetContainer paramConstraintWidgetContainer, LinearSystem paramLinearSystem, ConstraintWidget paramConstraintWidget)`: This method checks if the parent widget is set to match the parents width and/or height. If so, it sets up equalities to enforce these constraints in the provided linear system for each dimension (horizontal/vertical).

- `enabled(int paramInt1, int paramInt2)`: This method checks whether a parameter bit is set in an options flag (paramInt1) based on the provided bit mask (paramInt2). If the bit is found, it returns true; otherwise, it returns false.

The class also contains constant fields that are likely flags for different types of optimizations that can be performed in the solving system.
