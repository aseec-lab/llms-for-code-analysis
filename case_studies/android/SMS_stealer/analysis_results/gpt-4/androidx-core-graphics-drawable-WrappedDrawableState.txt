The `WrappedDrawableState` class extends `Drawable.ConstantState`, which provides a default implementation of a constantly running drawable. It holds the constant state variables like `mChangingConfigurations`, `mDrawableState`, `mTint`, and `mTintMode`.

A constructor is provided that takes another instance of `WrappedDrawableState` and copies its attributes. It also has a `canConstantState()` method to check if `mDrawableState` is not null.

It overrides `getChangingConfigurations()` from `Drawable.ConstantState` to return the bitwise OR of `mChangingConfigurations` of the current state and `getChangingConfigurations()` of `mDrawableState`.

It also overrides the `newDrawable()` method where it returns an instance of `WrappedDrawableApi21` for Android versions >= 21 or `WrappedDrawableApi14` for versions < 21, thus providing backward compatibility. It takes `Resources` as an optional parameter in the overloaded version of the method.

This class encapsulates mutable versions of Drawable state variables, allowing changes to be made while maintaining backward compatibility across different versions of Android.
