The `AppCompatCallback` interface in the `androidx.appcompat.app` package provides methods for handling actions on `ActionMode` objects in applications that use the AppCompat library for backward compatibility in Android.

Here's what each method does:

1. `onSupportActionModeStarted(ActionMode paramActionMode)`: This method is called when an `ActionMode` starts. It takes an `ActionMode` object as a parameter.

2. `onSupportActionModeFinished(ActionMode paramActionMode)`: This method is called when an `ActionMode` finishes. It also takes an `ActionMode` object as a parameter.

3. `onWindowStartingSupportActionMode(ActionMode.Callback paramCallback)`: This method is called when a window is starting an `ActionMode`. It takes an `ActionMode.Callback` object as a parameter and returns an `ActionMode`.

The interface must be implemented by any class that wants to receive these `ActionMode` related callbacks from the AppCompat library. It's used to maintain compatibility with older versions of Android.
