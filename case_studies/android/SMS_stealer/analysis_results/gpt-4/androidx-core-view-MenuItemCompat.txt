The `MenuItemCompat` is a utility class in the `androidx.core.view` package that provides compatibility methods for `MenuItem` interface in different versions of Android. 

These methods provide functionalities like getting and setting properties of `MenuItem`. Example methods include `setActionProvider`, `getActionView`, `collapseActionView`, `setShowAsAction` and other getters and setters for icons, shortcuts, and descriptions.

Additionally, it also provides backward compatibility for methods concerning alphabetic and numeric shortcuts, content and tooltip descriptions, and icon tinting.  

Please note that some methods of this class have already been deprecated. 

Also, it declares an interface `OnActionExpandListener` for callback actions on the expansion or collapse of a `MenuItem`.
