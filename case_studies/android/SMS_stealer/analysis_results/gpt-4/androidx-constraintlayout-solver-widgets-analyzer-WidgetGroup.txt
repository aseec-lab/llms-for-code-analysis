The `WidgetGroup` class is another part of Android's `constraintlayout.solver` package that helps manage layouts. Each `WidgetGroup` instance represents a collection of `ConstraintWidget` objects that are related in some way in the layout. It features variables for grouping ID, orientation, and authority of the group, along with methods for manipulating these widgets.

Some of the methods included in WidgetGroup class are:

1. `contains(ConstraintWidget)`: This method checks if a given `ConstraintWidget` is contained within the current `WidgetGroup`.
   
2. `measureWrap()': This function measures the wrap value for a given widget.

3. `solverMeasure()': Solve the layout using the LinearSystem solver provided, returning the calculated value.

4. `add()`: This method is used to add new `ConstraintWidget` to the current widget list. 

5. `apply()`: Applies stored measurement results if authoritative.

6. `cleanup()`: The method helps clean up the list of `WidgetGroups`, taking into consideration the size of widgets in the group.

7. `clear()`: It empties the widgets list in the group.

8. `intersectWith()`: Checks if this `WidgetGroup` intersects with another in terms of containing the same `ConstraintWidget`.

9. `moveTo()`: Moves all widgets in this group to another `WidgetGroup`.

10. `setAuthoritative()`: Used to set the authoritative status of the widget group.

The `MeasureResult` inner class is used to store the results of a measurement operation for a specific widget within the group.

In short, the class helps in managing groups of widgets in complex layouts, controlling their positioning and sizing including adding or moving widgets between groups.
