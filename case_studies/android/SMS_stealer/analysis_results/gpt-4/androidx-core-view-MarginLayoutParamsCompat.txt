The `MarginLayoutParamsCompat` class in AndroidX provides compatibility methods for working with `ViewGroup.MarginLayoutParams` across different versions of Android.

- `getLayoutDirection(ViewGroup.MarginLayoutParams)`: Returns the layout direction of the parameter MarginLayoutParams. If the SDK version is less than 17, it returns 0 by default.
  
- `getMarginEnd(ViewGroup.MarginLayoutParams)`: Returns the margin at the end of the MarginLayoutParams. If the SDK version is less than 17, it returns the right margin.
  
- `getMarginStart(ViewGroup.MarginLayoutParams)`: Returns the margin at the start of the MarginLayoutParams. If the SDK version is less than 17, it returns the left margin.
  
- `isMarginRelative(ViewGroup.MarginLayoutParams)`: Indicates whether the margins are relative or not. It returns `false` for SDK versions less than 17.
  
- `resolveLayoutDirection(ViewGroup.MarginLayoutParams, int)`: Resolves the layout direction for the MarginLayoutParams. This method has no effect for SDK versions less than 17.
  
- `setLayoutDirection(ViewGroup.MarginLayoutParams, int)`: Sets the layout direction for the MarginLayoutParams. This method has no effect for SDK versions less than 17.
  
- `setMarginEnd(ViewGroup.MarginLayoutParams, int)`: Sets the margin at the end of the MarginLayoutParams. For SDK versions less than 17, it sets the right margin.
  
- `setMarginStart(ViewGroup.MarginLayoutParams, int)`: Sets the margin at the start of the MarginLayoutParams. For SDK versions less than 17, it sets the left margin.

These methods allow developers to work with layout params and margins on views in a backward-compatible way, without checking for the Android version in their code.
