The `InternalNetworking` class in the `com.androidnetworking.internal` package of the Android Networking library provides HTTP networking functions related to the OkHttp library. The class has several modules:

- A static `OkHttpClient` named `sHttpClient` that is manipulated via `getClient()`, `getDefaultClient()`, `setClient()`, and `setClientWithCache()`. 

- `addHeadersToRequestBuilder()` function for adding headers to requests. 

- `enableLogging()` to log HTTP requests and responses.

- `performDownloadRequest(),` `performSimpleRequest(),` and `performUploadRequest()` are used to make a download, simple and upload request respectively, the requests constructed with OkHttp library. 

- It provides bandwidth updates via the `ConnectionClassManager`.

- `UserAgent` is a customizable string, added to each request in headers via `setUserAgent()`.

- Analytics info of each request is processed using the `Utils.sendAnalytics()` method.

This class plays a vital role in the functioning of the Android Networking library by handling the network operations.
