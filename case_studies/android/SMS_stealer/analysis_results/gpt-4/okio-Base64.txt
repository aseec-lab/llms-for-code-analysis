This file `Base64.java` from Okio library provides methods for encoding and decoding byte arrays and strings using Base64 and Base64Url.

There are two static final byte arrays `MAP` and `URL_MAP` which serve as mapping for base64 and base64Url encoding respectively.

The `decode(String paramString)` method takes a base64 encoded String and returns its byte array representation. It checks each character in string and converts it into byte representation.

The `encode(byte[] paramArrayOfbyte)` and `encodeUrl(byte[] paramArrayOfbyte)` methods generate a base64 or base64Url encoded string from a byte array.

The `encode(byte[] paramArrayOfbyte1, byte[] paramArrayOfbyte2)` method serves as a helper function which encodes byte array with either `MAP` or `URL_MAP` based on which encoding is to be used. This method is used by both `encode` and `encodeUrl` methods.
