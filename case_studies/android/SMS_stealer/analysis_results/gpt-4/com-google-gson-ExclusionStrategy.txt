The `ExclusionStrategy` is an interface in the Gson library. An implementation of this interface can be passed to a `GsonBuilder` to exclude certain fields or classes during the serialization and deserialization process.

This interface has two methods:

1. `shouldSkipClass(Class<?> paramClass)`: This method is used to exclude or skip the specified class during serialization/deserialization.

2. `shouldSkipField(FieldAttributes paramFieldAttributes)`: This method is used to exclude or skip the specified field during serialization/deserialization. 

`FieldAttributes` is a companion class that provides metadata about a field.

The file seems to be located in a jar file based on the commented location, and it was compiled with Java 6.
