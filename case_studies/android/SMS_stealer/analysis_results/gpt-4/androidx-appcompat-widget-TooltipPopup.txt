The provided Java class, `TooltipPopup`, is used to create and manage tooltip popups in an Android application. The tooltip is a text box displayed when a user hovers over or focuses on an element, providing relevant information or explanation about the element or its function. 

This class encapsulates the popupâ€™s content view and its message, position computations, and necessary adjustments considering anchor position and screen sizes. Once the tooltip's position is calculated, it is added to the window and thus visible to the user.

The main methods are:

- `TooltipPopup` (constructor): Initializes and inflates the tooltip view, sets layout parameters and message view.
  
- `computePosition`: Computes the position of the tooltip relative to anchor view taking into account if the tooltip is being shown due to a touch or non-touch interaction.
  
- `getAppRootView`: Returns the root view for the application.
   
- `hide`: Removes the tooltip view from the window, effectively hiding the tooltip.
  
- `isShowing`: Returns a boolean indicating whether the tooltip is currently being shown.
  
- `show`: Loads the message into the tooltip view and computes its position, then adds the tooltip view to the window, effectively showing the tooltip to the user.

The `TooltipPopup` class is part of the AndroidX AppCompat library which provides backward compatibility for Android applications.
