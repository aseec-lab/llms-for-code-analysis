`TextDirectionHeuristicCompat` is an interface in the AndroidX Core Text library. It defines methods to determine the text direction of given characters sequences, specifically whether the text is right-to-left (Rtl) or not.

The interface declares two methods:
- `isRtl(CharSequence paramCharSequence, int paramInt1, int paramInt2)`: Determines if the given sequence of characters (`paramCharSequence`), starting from the position (`paramInt1`) up to the number of characters (`paramInt2`), is in right-to-left text direction.
- `isRtl(char[] paramArrayOfchar, int paramInt1, int paramInt2)`: Same as above, but for an array of characters (`paramArrayOfchar`). 

These methods would be particularly useful in applications supporting bi-directional or right-to-left languages like Arabic, Hebrew, etc.
