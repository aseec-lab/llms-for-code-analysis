The `ConfigurationHelper` class provides utility methods related to device configuration.

- Specifically, this class has a static method `getDensityDpi(Resources paramResources)` which returns the screen density expressed as dots-per-inch (dpi) of the given `Resources` object. 

- The method uses the `densityDpi` attribute from the `Configuration` object of `Resources` for devices with API level 17 or higher. For devices with a lower API level, it retrieves the `densityDpi` attribute from the `DisplayMetrics` object of `Resources`.
