The `MockView` class extends the `View` class of Android and is used to create a customizable mock view primarily for testing purposes. The class includes a number of properties such as `mDiagonalsColor`, `mDrawDiagonals`, `mDrawLabel`, and `mText` which can be used to modify the appearance of the view. 

The `init(Context paramContext, AttributeSet paramAttributeSet)` method retrieves and sets these properties based on the provided `AttributeSet`. 

In the `onDraw(Canvas paramCanvas)` method, the class applies these properties to draw on the canvas. If `mDrawDiagonals` is `true`, a series of diagonal lines are drawn on the canvas. If the `mDrawLabel` is set to `true` and `mText` is not `null`, it draws the text on the canvas. The canvas modifications are done using the `Canvas` methods `drawLine`, `drawRect`, and `drawText`. 

This class can be used for custom UI testing or display purposes within the constraint layout context.
