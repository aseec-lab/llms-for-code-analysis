The `@TransitionRes` is an annotation type used in Android to denote that an integer parameter, method, or field refers to a Transition resource type on the system. This allows the Android linter (a program which analyzes your code for programming errors) to check the correctness of your code.

It can only be used to annotate a method, parameter, or field, due to the `@Target` annotation parameters.

The retention policy of this annotation is set to `SOURCE`. That mean it is not going to be included into bytecode during compile time, and is only used by tools and/or IDE which analyze the source code.

Lastly, the `@Documented` will ensure that whenever the annotation is used in your code, it will also appear in the produced Javadoc.
