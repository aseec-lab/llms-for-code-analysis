The `LifecycleOwner` is an interface in the `androidx.lifecycle` package. It has only one method, `getLifecycle()`, which is intended to be implemented by classes that have an associated `Lifecycle`. This `Lifecycle` object can be used by other classes to observe the LifecycleOwner's lifecycle events. This interface essentially marks a class as having an Android lifecycle, which is important for managing resources in a lifecycle-aware way.
