The `Size` annotation in Android is used to specify the size or length constraints of a collection, string, or array. 

It has four different parameters - `max`, `min`, `multiple`, and `value`. These parameters are long integers and are used to specify the size restrictions.

- `max()`: Defines the maximum size, the default is `Long.MAX_VALUE`.
- `min()`: Defines the minimum size, the default is `Long.MIN_VALUE`.
- `multiple()`: Defines the allowed multiples of the value's size. The default is `1`.
- `value()`: Defines an exact size for the value. The default is `-1`, which means it's ignored unless specified.

The `@Target` is set to `METHOD`, `PARAMETER`, `FIELD`, `LOCAL_VARIABLE` and `ANNOTATION_TYPE`, meaning it can be used to annotate all of these element types.

The `@Retention` policy is set to `CLASS`, specifying this annotation will be recorded in the class file by the compiler but need not be retained by the VM at run time.

The part at the end seems to be metadata about the file location and version info, not directly related to the `Size` annotation's functionality.
