The `TintableBackgroundView` interface in AndroidX Core library provides methods that allow for getting and setting background tint lists and modes for a view which implements this interface.

- `getSupportBackgroundTintList()`: This method is used to retrieve the color state list for tinting the background of a view.
- `getSupportBackgroundTintMode()`: This method retrieves the blending mode that's used to apply the background tint.
- `setSupportBackgroundTintList(ColorStateList paramColorStateList)`: This method is used to apply a color state list for tinting the view's background.
- `setSupportBackgroundTintMode(PorterDuff.Mode paramMode)`: It sets the mode that the background tint list should be applied with (i.e., how the colors should blend).

In all, this interface aids in customizing the look and feel (colors and transitions between colors) of a view in Android.
