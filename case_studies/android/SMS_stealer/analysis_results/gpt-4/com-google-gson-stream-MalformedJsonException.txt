The `MalformedJsonException` class is a type of `IOException` that is thrown when there is a problem with the format of a JSON input that the Gson library is trying to parse. 

The class constructor methods allow the exception to be created with just a string that describes the problem (`MalformedJsonException(String paramString)`), a string and a cause (`MalformedJsonException(String paramString, Throwable paramThrowable)`), or just a cause (`MalformedJsonException(Throwable paramThrowable)`). These different constructors offer flexibility in specifying the level of detail about the cause of the exception.
