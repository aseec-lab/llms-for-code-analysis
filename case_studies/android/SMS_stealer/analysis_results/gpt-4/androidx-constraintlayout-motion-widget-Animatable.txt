The `Animatable` interface defines two methods for classes that can animate a progress value:

- `getProgress()`: returns the current progress of the animation as a float.
- `setProgress(float paramFloat)`: sets the current progress of the animation with a float parameter.

Any class implementing this interface must define these two methods, essentially providing a way to control the progress of an animation.
