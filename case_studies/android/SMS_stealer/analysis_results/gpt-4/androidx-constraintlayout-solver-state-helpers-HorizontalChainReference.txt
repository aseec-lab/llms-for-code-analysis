The `HorizontalChainReference` class extends the `ChainReference` class and is a helper class used to create a horizontal chain of constraints in Android's ConstraintLayout solver.

- The constructor `HorizontalChainReference()` takes a `State` object as a parameter and sets the helper type to `HORIZONTAL_CHAIN`.
- `apply()` method is used to apply the constraints to the chain.  It initially clears any existing horizontal constraints. It then applies start and end constraints to each of the References in the horizontal chain. It also applies horizontal bias and chain style based on internal properties.
- `endToEnd()`, `endToStart()`, `startToEnd()`, and `startToStart()` are used to set the horizontal constraints of the chain relative to other objects.
- `mEndToEnd`, `mEndToStart`, `mStartToEnd`, `mStartToStart` are properties that this class uses to keep track of the objects this horizontal chain is constrained to.
