The `UploadProgressHandler` class extends the `Handler` class and is used to handle the progress of file uploads. It contains a `mUploadProgressListener` which listens to the upload process.

- The constructor `UploadProgressHandler` takes an `UploadProgressListener` as an argument which initializes the `mUploadProgressListener` object that listens to the upload progress.

- The `handleMessage(Message paramMessage)` method is overridden from the `Handler` class; it triggers an `onProgress()` callback (supplying the current bytes and total bytes) on the `mUploadProgressListener` object when a message with the `what` field equals to `1` is received. Other messages are handled by the superclass's `Handler.handleMessage()` method.

This class is part of the `com.androidnetworking.internal` package and appears to be from a decompiled `.jar` file, according to the comment at the bottom of the file.
