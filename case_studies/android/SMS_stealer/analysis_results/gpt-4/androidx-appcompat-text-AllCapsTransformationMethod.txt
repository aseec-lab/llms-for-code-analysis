The class `AllCapsTransformationMethod` implements the `TransformationMethod` interface from Android, which applies a distinct transformation to a specified CharSequence (for example, the text in a text view).

In the constructor `AllCapsTransformationMethod(Context paramContext)`, it gets the current locale from the resources and saves it to the `mLocale` field.

The `getTransformation(CharSequence paramCharSequence, View paramView)` method takes a `CharSequence` and a `View` as input. If the `CharSequence` is not `null`, this method converts every character in the `CharSequence` to uppercase using the locale saved, otherwise it sets the `CharSequence` to `null`.

The `onFocusChanged(View paramView, CharSequence paramCharSequence, boolean paramBoolean, int paramInt, Rect paramRect)` method is empty, which means focusing doesn't affect the transformation.

In summary, the class `AllCapsTransformationMethod` transforms all letters in a `CharSequence` to upper case according to the device's locale.
