This is an interface called `CookieJar` in the okhttp3 package. `CookieJar` has two main methods:

- `loadForRequest(HttpUrl paramHttpUrl)`: This method would typically be used to load cookies that should be attached with requests to the specified HttpUrl.
  
- `saveFromResponse(HttpUrl paramHttpUrl, List<Cookie> paramList)`: This method would typically be used to save cookies from server responses, which can be used in subsequent requests to the server.

There is also a static final instance `NO_COOKIES` of `CookieJar`, which is providing default behavior of `loadForRequest (returns an empty list of cookies)` and `saveFromResponse (does not do anything)`.

The `CookieJar` interface can be implemented to customize how cookies are provided for requests and saved from responses.
