The `DownloadListener` interface is part of the `com.androidnetworking.interfaces` package. 

This interface declares two methods:

1. `onDownloadComplete()`: This method is expected to be called when a download operation is successfully completed.

2. `onError(ANError paramANError)`: This method is used to handle errors during the download process. It accepts an argument of `ANError` type, which encapsulates error details.

Classes implementing this interface are expected to provide concrete implementations of these methods, essentially defining the behavior upon download completion and upon encountering an error during the download. This allows for flexibility in handling various kinds of downloads and different error scenarios.
