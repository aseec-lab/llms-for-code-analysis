The `Response` class in OkHttp represents an HTTP response. 

The class contains several fields like `body`, `cacheResponse`, `code`, `handshake`, `headers`, `message`, `networkResponse`, `priorResponse`, `protocol`, `receivedResponseAtMillis`, `request`, and `sentRequestAtMillis`. These fields represent the various parts of an HTTP response.

There are methods to get and manipulate all these fields. The `cacheControl()` method returns an instance of `CacheControl` parsed from the headers. The `isSuccessful()` method checks if the HTTP code represents a successful response (i.e., the code is in 200-299 range). The `peekBody(long paramLong)` method provides a sneak peek into the response body without consuming it. 

The `Builder` class nested inside the `Response` class allows building instances of `Response` using several setter methods. It validates the response (using methods like `checkPriorResponse()` and `checkSupportResponse()`) before building it to ensure it's well-formed. For example, it checks if the previous response's body was null (a requirement for a well-formed response).

This class is located at `okhttp3/Response.java`.The provided code is a part of the Builder class within the Response class of OkHttp library. The Builder class assists in the construction of HTTP response objects.
