The `ConstraintsChangedListener` is an abstract class which presumably is meant to be used as a listener for layout changes within your `ConstraintLayouts` in Android. 

You have two methods that will be called providing the respective context:

1. `postLayoutChange(int paramInt1, int paramInt2)` - This method is likely called after some layout change has occurred.

2. `preLayoutChange(int paramInt1, int paramInt2)` - This method is likely called before any layout change is to take place.

Both methods take two integer parameters, but without further code or documentation, it's unclear what these integers represent.

Currently, both methods do not perform any operations (they're empty), but they could be overridden in subclasses to provide specific functionality when a layout change occurs.
