The Flow class is a subclass of VirtualLayout and is a helper class that aids in applying constraints to components within the Android UI in a flow-based manner. This class is utilised when you want to position multiple widgets (views) in a flow-like layout where the position of each widget depends on the position of the previous widget in the flow. 

Flow supports horizontal and vertical layouts along with various styles like packed, spread, and spread inside for both orientations.

The class allows fine-grained control over the flow of elements, including setting the orientation of the flow, the style of horizontal and vertical alignment, how elements are wrapped, as well as setting biases and gaps. It also supports padding and maximum elements in a wrap.

For example, you can specify vertical gaps between elements, the wrapping behavior, and individual horizontal and vertical biases. These biases can control how elements are distributed in the flow layout. Various set methods like setHorizontalGap(), setVerticalGap(), setWrapMode() etc. are provided to control these properties.

In the init() method, it obtains style attributes from a given AttributeSet and uses those values to adjust the behavior of Flow.

The onMeasure() method is overridden to measure the size required by the flow for all elements.
