The `DrawableRes` annotation is a marker annotation in Android used to denote that the integer parameter, field, local variable, or method return type should represent a drawable resource reference, such as an image or xml-defined graphics. The `@Retention(RetentionPolicy.CLASS)` annotation indicates that this annotation will be recorded in the compiled .class file but ignored at runtime. The `@Target` annotation specifies that this annotation can be used with method declarations, parameters, fields, and local variables. The `@Documented` annotation indicates that elements annotated with `DrawableRes` should be documented using the Javadoc tool.
