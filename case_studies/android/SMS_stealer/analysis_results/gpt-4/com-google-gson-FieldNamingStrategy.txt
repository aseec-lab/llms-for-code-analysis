`FieldNamingStrategy` is an interface in the Gson library that is used to define a custom naming policy for the field names during the serialization and deserialization processes.

This interface has one method:

1. `translateName(Field paramField)`: This method accepts a `Field` object and returns the translated name of the field as a `String`. The translation refers to a custom naming policy done on the field names.

The exact name translation needs to be implemented by the user. For example, a user might implement this interface to convert camel-cased field names in a Java object to lower case with underscores when the object is converted to JSON. 

The file seems to be located in a jar file based on the commented location, and it was compiled with Java 6.
