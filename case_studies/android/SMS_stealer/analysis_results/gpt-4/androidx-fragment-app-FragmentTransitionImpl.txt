The provided `FragmentTransitionImpl.java` file defines an abstract class for fragment transitions in Android. Here's a brief overview of the key components and what they do:

- This class is used for controlling transitions between fragments. It contains various abstract methods that need to be implemented by subclasses, such as `addTarget()`, `beginDelayedTransition()`, `canHandle()`, `cloneTransition()`, `mergeTransitionsInSequence()`, etc. 

- It also has methods for managing transitioning views and named views using `captureTransitioningViews()` and `findNamedViews()`, respectively. 

- Common utilities like `isNullOrEmpty()`, `getBoundsOnScreen()`, `setNameOverridesOrdered()`, etc are also included.

- The method `setNameOverridesReordered()` is used to override the transition names for a reordered list.

- It also includes methods for scheduling the addition, removal, or replacement of targets in the transition.

Overall, the `FragmentTransitionImpl` class serves as a blueprint for creating classes that manage transitions between fragments in an Android application.
