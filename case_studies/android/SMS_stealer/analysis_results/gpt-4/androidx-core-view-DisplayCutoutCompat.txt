The `DisplayCutoutCompat` class provides a compatibility wrapper for working with display cutouts on Android devices. A display cutout is an area where the device's primary display is not present, such as the notch on top of some newer smartphones.

The class contains methods to get the safe area insets and a list of bounding rectangles for the cutout areas. These methods delegate their call to the respective methods of the `DisplayCutout` class from the Android API. If the device's Android API version is less than 28 (i.e., Android 9 Pie), these methods will return default values (either 0 or null) since the `DisplayCutout` API is not available.

The class also contains a `wrap()` static method to create an instance of `DisplayCutoutCompat` using an `Object`, `unwrap()` method to return the underlying `DisplayCutout` object, `equals()`, `hashCode()`, and `toString()` methods which are standard Java methods often used for comparison and string representation of object state.
