`@ColorInt` is an annotation defined in the AndroidX library. It is used to denote that a parameter, method, local variable, or a field, represents an ARGB (Alpha, Red, Green, Blue) color.

The `@Retention(RetentionPolicy.CLASS)` annotation indicates this annotation will be recorded in the .class file by the compiler but will not be retained by the VM at runtime. 

The `@Target` annotation specifies the kinds of program element to which an annotation type is applicable. Here, it can be applied to a method, parameter, field, or a local variable.

The comment afterwards provides metadata about the location, Java compiler version, and JD-Core version, possibly when the .class file was decompiled.
