The `AppCompatCheckBox` class extends the standard Android CheckBox, and compatible with older Android versions. It provides more functionalities and customization features compared to the regular CheckBox control. 

It has three helper classes: `AppCompatBackgroundHelper`, `AppCompatCompoundButtonHelper`, `AppCompatTextHelper`. These helper classes add the ability to apply tint for different parts of the CheckBox label text, CompoundButton, and its background.

Several methods exist for setting and getting properties such as support for button tint list, support for background tint mode, setting background drawable.

The `drawableStateChanged` method guarantees that each time the state of drawable changes, changes would be applied to both CompoundButton and background.

The `setButtonDrawable` method is overridden to make sure the tinting is applied each time a drawable is set for a CompoundButton.
