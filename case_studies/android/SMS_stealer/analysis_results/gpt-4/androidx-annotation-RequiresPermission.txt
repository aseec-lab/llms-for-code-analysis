The `RequiresPermission` annotation is defined in the AndroidX library. It's used to specify that a certain permission is needed for a method to be executed, a field to be accessed, or a parameter to be set. Here are the main components:

- `String[] allOf() default {}`: Used to specify all permissions that are required.
- `String[] anyOf() default {}`: Used to specify any permissions that could satisfy the requirement.
- `boolean conditional() default false`: Used to specify if the permission is conditional. Defaults to `false`.
- `String value() default ""`: Used to pass a single permission as a string.
- `Read`: A nested annotation indicating the required permission to read.
- `Write`: A nested annotation indicating the required permission to write.

The `@Retention(RetentionPolicy.CLASS)` annotation indicates that this annotation will be recorded in the .class file by the compiler but will not be retained by the VM at runtime. The `@Target` annotation specifies that this annotation type can be applied to a method, parameter, field, or a constructor.
