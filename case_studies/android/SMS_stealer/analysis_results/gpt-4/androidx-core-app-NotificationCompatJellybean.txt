The `NotificationCompatJellybean` class provides support for working with the notification functionalities of the Jelly Bean (and onwards) Android API. It has several string keys to tag different parts of a notification like allowing generated replies, remote inputs, action intent, allowed data types, label, icon, etc.

The class has methods that help in:

1. Reading and building action extras from `SparseArray` and `Bundle` objects.
2. Retrieving action count within a notification.
3. Providing access to notification action objects via reflection.
4. Extracting, getting and putting bundle objects related to notification actions.
5. Providing compatibility for getting remote inputs and extras from the notification. 

Note that several of these functionalities make use of Java reflection, which is a method of inspecting or modifying the runtime behaviour of a class at runtime. This is especially useful when dealing with compatibility layers such as this, where the APIs may differ across different versions of Android.1. The method `getExtrasField()` retrieves the Bundle stored in the field "extras" of a Notification object. In case the field is not of type Bundle or doesn't exist, it sets a flag `sExtrasFieldAccessFailed` and logs an error message. All exceptions related to accessing notification extras are caught, logged, and then set `sExtrasFieldAccessFailed` to true.

2. The `readAction()` method creates a `NotificationCompat.Action` object. Depending on whether a given Bundle object is null or not, it retrieves arrays of RemoteInput objects and a boolean from the Bundle, and uses these to instantiate the Action object.

3. The methods `toBundle()` and `toBundleArray()` are helper methods. `toBundle()` converts a RemoteInput object into a Bundle, inserting all the RemoteInput's properties into the Bundle. `toBundleArray()` loop over an array of RemoteInput objects and creates an array of Bundles, one for each RemoteInput object in the array.

4. The `writeActionAndGetExtras()` method configures a Notification.Builder object with data from a given Action object and returns a Bundle containing the extras of the Action. It sets the action's icon resource ID, title, and action intent on the Builder, then builds a Bundle out of the action's extras and adds the remote inputs and data-only remote inputs to it (if they exist). It also puts the value of `paramAction.getAllowGeneratedReplies()` into the Bundle.
