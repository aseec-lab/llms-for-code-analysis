The `FileSystem` interface in OkHttp provides a set of methods for interacting with the file system. These methods allow for operations such as writing to a file, deleting a file, checking if a file exists, renaming a file, getting the size of a file, and reading from a file.

1. `appendingSink(File paramFile)`: Create a `Sink` that can be used to append data to the provided file.
2. `delete(File paramFile)`: Delete the provided file. An exception is thrown if the file exists but cannot be deleted.
3. `deleteContents(File paramFile)`: Delete the contents of the provided directory. An exception is thrown if the operation fails or if the provided file is not a directory.
4. `exists(File paramFile)`: Check if the provided file exists.
5. `rename(File paramFile1, File paramFile2)`: Rename the first file to the second file. The destination file is deleted if it already exists.
6. `sink(File paramFile)`: Create a `Sink` that can be used to write data to the provided file.
7. `size(File paramFile)`: Return the size of the provided file.
8. `source(File paramFile)`: Create a `Source` that can be used to read data from the provided file.

The `SYSTEM` constant is a default implementation of the `FileSystem` interface, using the local file system. If a file operation error occurs, this implementation will attempt to recover if possible (e.g., by creating parent directories), or fail with an exception.
