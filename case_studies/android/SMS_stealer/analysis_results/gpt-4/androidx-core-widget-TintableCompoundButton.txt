The `TintableCompoundButton` interface is a part of the AndroidX Core library. It provides methods for setting and retrieving tint information for the compound button, a component that combines a button and a checkbox or radio button.

1. `getSupportButtonTintList()`: This method returns the current [`ColorStateList`](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/content/res/ColorStateList) being used to tint the compound button.

2. `getSupportButtonTintMode()`: This method retrieves the current blending mode (`PorterDuff.Mode`) being used to tint the compound button.

3. `setSupportButtonTintList(ColorStateList paramColorStateList)`: This method sets `paramColorStateList` as the new `ColorStateList` for tinting the compound button.

4. `setSupportButtonTintMode(PorterDuff.Mode paramMode)`: This method sets `paramMode` as the new blending mode for tinting the compound button. It influences how the tint color mixes with the compound button's original color.
