The `AppCompatButton` class is a subclass of Android's Button control that has additional support for more features on older platform versions. It incorporates additional functionality for tintable background and auto-sizing of text among others.

The class achieves this functionality by using helper classes (`AppCompatBackgroundHelper` and `AppCompatTextHelper`). These are initialized with attributes of the button and are used throughout the class to support additional features.

The `AppCompatButton` Class has methods for handling drawable states, auto-sized text accessibility actions and layout changes, etc. It also modifies core Button methods such as `setBackgroundDrawable`, `setBackgroundResource`, `setTextAppearance`, and `setTextSize`, and includes methods to set and get tint properties for both background and compound drawables, supporting color state lists and blending modes.

It also provides a method to set a custom selection ActionMode callback for the text in the button and implements methods to support compound drawable tinting.
