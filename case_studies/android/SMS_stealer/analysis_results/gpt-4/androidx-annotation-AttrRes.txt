The `AttrRes` annotation in Android is used to denote that an integer parameter, method return value, or field references an attribute resource, for example an ID in the R.attr array. The R.attr array contains IDs for all attribute resources defined in your project. 

This annotation is documented (`@Documented`), included in the class file when the program is compiled but is ignored at runtime (`@Retention(RetentionPolicy.CLASS)`), and can be applied to methods, parameters, fields, or local variables (`@Target({ElementType.METHOD, ElementType.PARAMETER, ElementType.FIELD, ElementType.LOCAL_VARIABLE})`).

The comment at the end of the file contains information about the Java compiler and JD-Core Decompiler versions used.
