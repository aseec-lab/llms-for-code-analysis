`Observer<T>` is an interface defined in the androidx.lifecycle package. It has just one method, `onChanged(T paramT)`. 

The purpose of this interface is to receive notifications when data observed by it changes. 

It acts as a contract for any class that wants to act as an observer in the Observer pattern where `Observer<T>` will be notified of changes to the observed data (`T paramT`). 

In the context of Android's Lifecycle library, this interface is typically implemented by classes that need to respond to changes in lifecycle-aware data holders, like `LiveData` objects.
