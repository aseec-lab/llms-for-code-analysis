The `WithHint` interface is defined in the `androidx.appcompat.widget` package. It is a simple interface with just one method, `getHint()`. This method is designed to return a `CharSequence`, which is typically used to provide a user-facing hint associated with the implementing object. Examples could include hint text in an editable text box or a tooltip for a button. The method does not take any arguments and there are no guidelines or requirements for how the hint is determined or stored by the implementing class.
