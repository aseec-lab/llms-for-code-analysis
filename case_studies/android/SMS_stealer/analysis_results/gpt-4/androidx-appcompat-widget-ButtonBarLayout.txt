The `ButtonBarLayout` is a subclass of `LinearLayout`. The primary purpose of this class is to create a layout that can stack its child views vertically or horizontally based on the space available.

When the layout width is larger than its previous width and the layout is in stacked mode, it will be reset to non-stacked mode.

The `setStacked` method is used to stack children vertically when there is not enough horizontal space. If stacked, the gravity is set to RIGHT(`5`), and a child view with id `spacer` is hidden; otherwise gravity is set to BOTTOM(`80`) and `spacer` is partially hidden.

The `onMeasure` method is overridden to recalculate its size and decide whether views should be stacked or not based on the available width. If stacking is required, the `onMeasure` method is called again after stacking the views.

The `setAllowStacking` method is used to allow or disallow stacking. If stacking is disallowed and the orientation is vertical, it resets the stacking.

This layout class is typically used in dialogs for actions like 'CANCEL'/'OK' which can be stacked vertically or horizontally based on available space.
