The `ResourcesFlusher` class in the AndroidX AppCompat library is an internal utility used to clear or "flush" preloaded resource caches in an application's `Resources` object. This is useful when you want to make sure that all resources are freshly loaded and any cached data is removed - for instance, when you've dynamically changed a resource value and want to make sure all components reload this resource.

The class has separate flushing methods for different Android versions (`flushLollipops`, `flushMarshmallows`, `flushNougats`) due to changes in the fields and classes related to resource caching across different Android versions.

The `flush()` method determines the Android version and calls the corresponding resource flush method. Each flush method attempts to access the resource cache through reflection to bypass private access, and clear it.

The method `flushThemedResourcesCache()` is used for flushing themed resource cache. It's used by `flushMarshmallows` and `flushNougats` methods. 

In the case where accessibility for certain fields could not be set or the value could not be received due to exceptions, error messages are logged.
