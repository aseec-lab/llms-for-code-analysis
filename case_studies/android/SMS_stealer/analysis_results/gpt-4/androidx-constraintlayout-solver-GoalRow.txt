This Java class, named `GoalRow`, extends the ArrayRow class which comes with some inbuilt functionality. The `GoalRow` class has a constructor for instantiating it with a `Cache` object and passes this object to the super `ArrayRow` class.

After the class has been instantiated, there's a function named `addError`. This function is for adding an error to a SolverVariable object (presumably, some kind of error handling or tracking method). This function both calls a similar function in the super class and manually decreases the usageInRowCount value of the SolverVariable object by 1.
