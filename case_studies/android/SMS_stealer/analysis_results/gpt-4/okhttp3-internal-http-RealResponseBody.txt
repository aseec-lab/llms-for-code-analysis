The `RealResponseBody` class is an implementation of the `ResponseBody` abstract class in OkHttp.

1) It declares three private variables: `contentLength` to store the length of the response body, `contentTypeString` to store the content type of the response body as a string, and `source` to store the source of the response body as a `BufferedSource`.

2) The constructor `RealResponseBody()` takes these three parameters and assigns them to their corresponding instance variables. 

3) The `contentLength()` method returns the length of the response body.

4) The `contentType()` method returns the content type of the response body as a `MediaType` object. If the `contentTypeString` is null, it returns null.

5) The `source()` method returns the source of the response body as a `BufferedSource`.
