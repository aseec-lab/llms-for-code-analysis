The `AndroidResources` class is a utility class that is used to manage and maintain the constants related to the animation attributes in Android. The constants here correspond to various styleables that are used in defining and manipulating animations, such as styleable animator, styleable keyframe, styleable vector, path interpolators, and others.

The constant declarations map to the integer values of these various attributes used in Android resources. For instance, the variables `FAST_OUT_LINEAR_IN`, `FAST_OUT_SLOW_IN`, and `LINEAR_OUT_SLOW_IN` correspond to the style ID of the Android interpolation modes.

It also defines a series of styleable arrays (`STYLEABLE_VECTOR_DRAWABLE_GROUP`, `STYLEABLE_VECTOR_DRAWABLE_PATH`, etc.) with corresponding integer index constants for specific attributes (like path name, stroke color, trim path start, etc.). These constants can be used to access attributes of Android Vector Drawables in a type-safe manner. 

Furthermore, a static block at the end of the class initializes these styleable arrays with their respective attribute IDs. 

In summary, this class is a container for various constants that you might need when working with animation-related features in Android.
