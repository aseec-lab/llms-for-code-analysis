The `FragmentContainer` is an abstract class that provides methods to handle and manage a Fragment within a container.

The `instantiate` method, which is deprecated now, was used to create an instance of a fragment using a context, a String, and a bundle. It uses the `instantiate` method of the Fragment class.

The `onFindViewById` method is abstract and is used to find a view within the FragmentContainer using its id. Its implementation is specific to the subclasses.

The `onHasView` is an abstract method that is used to check whether the FragmentContainer has a view or not. Its implementation is specific to the subclasses.
