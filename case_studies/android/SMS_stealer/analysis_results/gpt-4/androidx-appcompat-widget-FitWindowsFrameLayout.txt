The `FitWindowsFrameLayout` class is a subclass of the Android `FrameLayout` class and implements the `FitWindowsViewGroup` interface. It's part of the `androidx.appcompat.widget` package. 

It provides two constructors, one that takes a `Context` object and another that takes both a `Context` and `AttributeSet` object, both default to their super class `FrameLayout` constructors.

It also contains a method `fitSystemWindows(Rect paramRect)`. The method checks if a `OnFitSystemWindowsListener` has been set. If it has, the `fitSystemWindows` method of this listener is then called. After calling this listener, it calls the super class `fitSystemWindows` method. 

Finally, a method `setOnFitSystemWindowsListener` is provided to set the `OnFitSystemWindowsListener`.

This class is designed to be a `FrameLayout` that can interact with the system windows. For instance, it can adjust its layout based on whether the system windows (like status bar and navigation bar) are visible or not.
