The `HtmlCompat` class is a utility class used for HTML-related operations such as converting HTML to spanned text (`fromHtml`) and vice versa (`toHtml`). 

It contains numerous constants related to HTML formatting options like `FROM_HTML_MODE_COMPACT`, `FROM_HTML_MODE_LEGACY`, `FROM_HTML_OPTION_USE_CSS_COLORS`, etc, which represent different modes or options available for HTML conversion.

The `fromHtml` methods are used to get a `Spanned` text from the supplied HTML string. Depending on the Android version, it might use a different method under the hood (`Html.fromHtml(paramString, paramInt)` for Android 24 and upward; `Html.fromHtml(paramString)` otherwise).

`toHtml` method converts `Spanned` text into an HTML string. Similar to `fromHtml`, it uses different underlying methods depending on the Android version.
