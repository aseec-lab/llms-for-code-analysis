The `ConnectionQualityChangeListener` is an interface in the `com.androidnetworking.interfaces` package. This interface declares a method called `onChange`. 

`void onChange(ConnectionQuality paramConnectionQuality, int paramInt);`: This method will be called when there is a change in connection quality during the networking request. The new ConnectionQuality and an integer parameter, possibly indicating the severity or level of the change, are passed to this method.

Any class implementing `ConnectionQualityChangeListener` will have to provide a specific implementation for this method. The action to be taken when connection quality changes during a networking request will be defined in this method.
