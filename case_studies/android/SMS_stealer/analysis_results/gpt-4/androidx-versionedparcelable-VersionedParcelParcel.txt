The `VersionedParcelParcel` class extends `VersionedParcel` and is a helper class for handling Android's Parcel data types. It manages reading and writing of parcelable objects into an inter-process communication primitive.

Below are the descriptions for some of its methods:

- `closeField()`: Closes the current field being processed and updates the parcel data position.
  
- `createSubParcel()`: Creates a sub-parcel with the current parcel properties.

- `readXXX` methods: These set of methods are responsible for reading different data types from the parcel i.e., Integers, Strings, Boolean, Parcelable, etc.

- `readField(int paramInt)`: Checks if the provided id has more data and then reads the next item based on its id.

- `setOutputField(int paramInt)`: Closes the current field being processed and opens a new one by moving the parcel data position to it.

- `writeXXX` methods: These set of methods are responsible for writing different data types into the parcel i.e., Integers, Strings, Boolean, Parcelable, etc.
