This is a `R` class in the `androidx.lifecycle` package. However, the class is empty and does not contain any methods or variables. Often, `R` classes in Android are auto-generated and contain references to resources, like strings, layouts, or drawables. But this one doesn't have anything inside it. The reference comments at the bottom indicate where the class is located and its Java compiler version.
