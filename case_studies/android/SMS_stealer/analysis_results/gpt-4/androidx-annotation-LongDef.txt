The `@LongDef` annotation is provided by the AndroidX library. It can be used to define new types of int or long to ensure the validity of values and enhance code readability.

It has two optional properties `flag` and `open`. `flag` is a boolean, if it's set, values can be used as flags, and can be combined together. `open` is also a boolean that if marked as true, places no restrictions on the annotated element's value.

The `value` attribute is used to specify the allowed set of values.

The `@Retention(RetentionPolicy.SOURCE)` annotation specifies that this annotation is not going to be included in the class file, and is used only by tools during the compilation process.

The `@Target({ElementType.ANNOTATION_TYPE})` annotation specifies that this annotation can only be used on other annotations.

The trailing information is metadata related to the Java Decompiler (JD-Core) and doesn't impact the functionality of the annotation.
