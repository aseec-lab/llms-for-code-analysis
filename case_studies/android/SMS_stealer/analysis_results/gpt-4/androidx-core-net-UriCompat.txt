The `UriCompat` class is a utility class for working with Uri instances in Android. It contains a single public static method, `toSafeString(Uri paramUri)`, which returns a "safe" string representation of the provided Uri object.

This method first retrieves the scheme of the Uri and its scheme-specific part. Then it checks the scheme against known categories (like "tel", "sip", "sms", "mailto", "http", etc.).

If the scheme is one of the sensitive ones (e.g., "tel", "sip"), the method obscures sensitive parts of the scheme-specific portion, such as replacing identifiable characters with 'x'.

If the scheme is a network protocol (like "http", "https"), it constructs a safe string representation with the host and port (if present), but omits the path, query, and fragment parts.

If the scheme is neither sensitive nor a network protocol, it appends the scheme and the full scheme-specific part to the response.

These transformations ensure that sensitive information is not leaked through the Uri string representation.
