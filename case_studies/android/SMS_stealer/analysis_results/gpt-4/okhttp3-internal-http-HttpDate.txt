The `HttpDate` class in OkHttp is a utility class for handling HTTP dates. It provides functionality for formatting and parsing dates according to HTTP headers standards.

1) It has `STANDARD_DATE_FORMAT` which is a ThreadLocal object that contains a SimpleDateFormat for formatting and parsing date Strings in HTTP headers. The format is "EEE, dd MMM yyyy HH:mm:ss 'GMT'", which is a standard HTTP/1.1 date format.

2) The class contains an array of Strings, `BROWSER_COMPATIBLE_DATE_FORMAT_STRINGS`, which holds date formats that might be used in browsers but not strictly compliant with the HTTP/1.1 specification.

3) There are two methods `format` and `parse`. The `format` method formats a Date object into the standard HTTP date format. The `parse` method parses a date String by firstly trying to parse it using the standard HTTP date format, if unsuccessful, it goes through the array of browser-compliant formats trying to parse the String until it finds a match.

4) The `MAX_DATE` variable is the maximum possible date in milliseconds since the Epoch. This variable is used to prevent time value overflows.

5) All of the date operations are in the UTC timezone, as indicated by the use of `Util.UTC`.
