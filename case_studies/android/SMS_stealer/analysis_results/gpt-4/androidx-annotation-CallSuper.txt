The `@CallSuper` annotation in Android is a marker annotation that is used to indicate that a method should always be called in the method that overrides it. For instance, if you have a base class with a method that has some functionality and a subclass is overriding this method, you would use the `@CallSuper` annotation on the method in the base class to ensure that when overriding this method in the subclass, the base class's method is always called.

The `@Retention(RetentionPolicy.CLASS)` annotation indicates that this annotation will be kept in the compiled .class file, but will be ignored by the JVM runtime. 

The `@Target` annotation restricts this annotation to be applied only to method declarations.

The `@Documented` annotation is a marker annotation that indicates that whenever the `@CallSuper` annotation is used those elements should be documented using the Javadoc tool. (The Javadoc tool will generate the API documentation in HTML format.)
