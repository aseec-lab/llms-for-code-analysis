The `Loader<D>` class is a utility class that manages asynchronous loading of data in an Android application. 

Here are the key functionalities:

1. `Loader(Context paramContext)`: Constructor that creates the Loader with the provided context.

2. `abandon()`, `cancelLoad()`, `reset()`, `startLoading()`, `stopLoading()`: Methods used for manually managing the loader lifecycle.

3. `registerListener(OnLoadCompleteListener<D> paramOnLoadCompleteListener)`, `unregisterListener(OnLoadCompleteListener<D> paramOnLoadCompleteListener)`, `registerOnLoadCanceledListener(OnLoadCanceledListener<D> paramOnLoadCanceledListener)`, `unregisterOnLoadCanceledListener(OnLoadCanceledListener<D> paramOnLoadCanceledListener)`: Methods used for setting up listeners for the completion or cancellation of the load operation.

4. `onContentChanged()`: Invoked when there's a change in the content that this loader is reporting. For example, if this loader is for querying a `ContentProvider`, it gets called when the data in the `ContentProvider` changes.

5. `deliverCancellation()`, `deliverResult(D paramD)`: Methods to deliver the results to registered listeners.

6. `dump(String paramString, FileDescriptor paramFileDescriptor, PrintWriter paramPrintWriter, String[] paramArrayOfString)`: Method for generating debugging output.

7. `ForceLoadContentObserver`: An inner class that extends `ContentObserver` and is used for listening to changes in data.

8. Interfaces `OnLoadCanceledListener<D>`, `OnLoadCompleteListener<D>`: Interfaces to set up callbacks for listening to events related to completion or cancellation of the load operation. 

The class keeps track of whether it has been started, is processing a change, has been reset or abandoned, or had its content changed. Any registered listeners will receive notifications upon completion or cancellation of loading.
