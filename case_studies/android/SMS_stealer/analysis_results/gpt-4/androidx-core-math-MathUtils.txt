The `MathUtils` is a utility class in Android that provides methods for clamping (i.e. constraining) values within a specified range.

In detail: 
- `clamp(double paramDouble1, double paramDouble2, double paramDouble3)`: Restricts a double value to the inclusive range from `paramDouble2` to `paramDouble3`. If the value is less than `paramDouble2`, it returns `paramDouble2`. If it's more than `paramDouble3`, it returns `paramDouble3`. Else, it returns the value itself.

- `clamp(float paramFloat1, float paramFloat2, float paramFloat3)`: Similar to the method above but for float values.

- `clamp(int paramInt1, int paramInt2, int paramInt3)`: This method restricts the integer `paramInt1` to the inclusive range from `paramInt2` to `paramInt3`.

- `clamp(long paramLong1, long paramLong2, long paramLong3)`: This method also does the same operation as stated above but it deals with long integer numbers.

These methods enable developers to ensure a variable remains within a certain range, which can be useful in several contexts, such as controlling color values, screen dimensions, or numerical computations.
