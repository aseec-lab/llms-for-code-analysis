The `MenuItemHoverListener` interface in the androidx.appcompat.widget package is an abstraction that provides two methods for handling hover events on menu items. The methods are:

 - `void onItemHoverEnter(MenuBuilder paramMenuBuilder, MenuItem paramMenuItem)`: This method is called when the hover event enters a MenuItem. It accepts two parameters: the current MenuBuilder object (`paramMenuBuilder`) and the MenuItem object (`paramMenuItem`) over which the hover event has occurred. 

 - `void onItemHoverExit(MenuBuilder paramMenuBuilder, MenuItem paramMenuItem)`: This method is called when the hover event exits a MenuItem. It too accepts the current MenuBuilder object (`paramMenuBuilder`) and the MenuItem object (`paramMenuItem`) over which the hover event has occurred.

Applications or classes implementing this interface need to provide concrete implementations of these methods to handle the hover event correctly. 

(Note: The `MenuBuilder` class is a part of androidx.appcompat.view.menu package and is a concrete implementation of the Menu interface from the Android framework. `MenuItem` is an interface in the Android framework representing a single item in a menu.)
