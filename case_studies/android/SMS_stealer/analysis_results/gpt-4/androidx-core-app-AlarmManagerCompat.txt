The `AlarmManagerCompat` class is a utility class that provides compatibility methods for interacting with an `AlarmManager`. It contains four static methods:

1. `setAlarmClock`: This method is used to set an alarm clock. If the device's Android version is 21 (Lollipop) or higher, it uses the `setAlarmClock` method of the `AlarmManager`, otherwise, it uses the `setExact` method defined in this class.

2. `setAndAllowWhileIdle`: This method sets an alarm that will fire even when the device is idle. If the Android version is 23 (Marshmallow) or higher, it uses the `setAndAllowWhileIdle` method of the `AlarmManager`, otherwise, it uses the `set` method of the `AlarmManager`.

3. `setExact`: This method sets an exact alarm. If the Android version is 19 (KitKat) or higher, it uses the `setExact` method of the `AlarmManager`, otherwise, it uses the `set` method of the `AlarmManager`.

4. `setExactAndAllowWhileIdle`: This method sets an exact alarm that will fire even when the device is idle. If the Android version is 23 or higher, it uses the `setExactAndAllowWhileIdle` method of the `AlarmManager`, otherwise, it uses the `setExact` method defined in this class.
