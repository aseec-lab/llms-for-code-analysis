The `EditorInfoCompat` class enables compatibility with different Android versions for the `EditorInfo` class, which is used by input methods for standard information about the text being edited. This class includes methods to get and set MIME types which represent the types of content that can be handled.

Key features:

1. `getContentMimeTypes(EditorInfo paramEditorInfo)`: This method retrieves the MIME types associated with the `paramEditorInfo` instance. The MIME type is determined based on the Android version.

2. `getProtocol(EditorInfo paramEditorInfo)`: This method identifies the protocol version used (includes compatibility considerations).

3. `setContentMimeTypes(EditorInfo paramEditorInfo, String[] paramArrayOfString)`: This method sets the MIME types for the `paramEditorInfo` instance. The method of setting depends on the Android version.
