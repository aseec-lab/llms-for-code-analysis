The `ScrollingView` interface provides hooks to calculate horizontal and vertical scroll ranges, offsets, and extents. These methods are used mainly for displaying scroll bars or for implementing custom scrolling effects.

- `computeHorizontalScrollExtent`: Used to compute the horizontal length of the portion that is currently visible.
- `computeHorizontalScrollOffset`: Used to compute the current horizontal scroll offset.
- `computeHorizontalScrollRange`: Used to compute the total horizontal length that can be scrolled.
- `computeVerticalScrollExtent`: Used to compute the vertical length of the portion that is currently visible.
- `computeVerticalScrollOffset`: Used to compute the current vertical scroll offset.
- `computeVerticalScrollRange`: Used to compute the total vertical length that can be scrolled.
