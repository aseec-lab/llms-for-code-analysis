The `OkHttpResponseAndStringRequestListener` interface is part of the `com.androidnetworking.interfaces` package. It defines a listener for network request and response handling. It provides two methods:

1. `void onError(ANError paramANError);`: This method is called when an error occurs while making the network request. The `paramANError` provides details about the error.

2. `void onResponse(Response paramResponse, String paramString);`: This method is called when a response is received for the network request. The `paramResponse` is the raw HTTP response from OkHttp and `paramString` is the response body as a string.

This interface would be useful when you need to handle both raw OkHttp `Response` and the response body as a string together. This can be beneficial when the response body is a simple text and does not need any parsing.
