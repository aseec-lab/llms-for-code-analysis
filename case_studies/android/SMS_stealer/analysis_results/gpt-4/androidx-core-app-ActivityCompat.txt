The `ActivityCompat` class in the AndroidX Core library provides backward-compatible versions of APIs released in new versions of the Android platform. 

Some key functionality includes:

- App transitioning and shared element callbacks: There are methods to handle transitions and shared element callbacks, such as `finishAfterTransition`, `postponeEnterTransition`, `setEnterSharedElementCallback`, and `startPostponedEnterTransition`.
  
- Permission requesting and checking: It has methods for requesting permissions with compatibility checks, getting a reference to the permission delegate, and showing rationale for a permission request.

- Activity-related actions: The class includes methods for starting an activity or an `IntentSender` for result, and for finishing an activity in an affinity-specific way or after a transition.

- View-related methods: They include `requireViewById` for obtaining a `View` instance referenced by a particular ID, with exception handling for nonexistent IDs.

- Uri retrieval: Enables getting the referrer of an activity with the `getReferrer` method.

The class contains three nested interfaces: `OnRequestPermissionsResultCallback` for handling the results of permission requests, `PermissionCompatDelegate` for delegating permission handling, and `RequestPermissionsRequestCodeValidator` for validating request codes related to permissions. 

Furthermore, it includes a private static subclass `SharedElementCallback21Impl` that extends the `SharedElementCallback` class for implementing shared element transitions.
