The `AccessibilityViewCommand` interface contains several classes that define commands which can be performed on views for the purpose of accessibility. It takes a `Bundle` object to store information needed for the command. Here are the classes:

`CommandArguments`: This abstract class stores a `Bundle` object and provides a method to set this bundle.

`MoveAtGranularityArguments`: Contains methods to get information for moving the cursor at a specified granularity level while extending selection or not.

`MoveHtmlArguments`: Contains a method to get the HTML element string from the bundle.

`MoveWindowArguments`: Contains methods to get the X and Y coordinates for moving a window.

`ScrollToPositionArguments`: Contains methods to get row and column information for scrolling to a particular position.

`SetProgressArguments`: Contains a method to get progress value for setting progress bar.

`SetSelectionArguments`: Contains methods to get the start and end indices for setting selection on a text.
