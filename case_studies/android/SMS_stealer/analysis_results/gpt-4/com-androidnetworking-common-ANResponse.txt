The `ANResponse` class in the Android Networking library is a generic wrapper for both successful and failed network requests. 

- The `ANError mANError` field represents an error, if any occurred during the network request.
- The `T mResult` field represents a result of a successful request.
- The `Response response` field represents the OkHttp response.

The constructor methods are overloaded to create an instance of `ANResponse` with either an `ANError` object or a result object. 

Other methods in the class include:

- `public static <T> ANResponse<T> failed(ANError paramANError)`: This static method returns a new `ANResponse` instance by using an `ANError` object.

- `public static <T> ANResponse<T> success(T paramT)`: This static method returns a new `ANResponse` instance by using a result object.

- `public ANError getError()`: This method returns an `ANError` object if the request failed, typically null if the request was successful.

- `public T getResult()`: This method returns the result of the successful request, typically null if the request failed.

- `public boolean isSuccess()`: This method checks if the network request was successful or not. If `mANError` is null, then the request was successful and true is returned otherwise false is returned.
  
- `public void setOkHttpResponse(Response paramResponse)`, `public Response getOkHttpResponse()`: These methods are used to set and get the OkHttp response respectively. 

- `ANResponse(ANError paramANError)`, `ANResponse(T paramT)`: Two constructors that initialize an `ANResponse` object with either an error (in case of failure) or the requested object (in case of success).
