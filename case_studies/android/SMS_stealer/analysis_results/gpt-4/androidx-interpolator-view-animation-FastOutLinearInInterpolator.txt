This code defines a class called `FastOutLinearInInterpolator` which extends the `LookupTableInterpolator` class. 

The `FastOutLinearInInterpolator` class has a pre-defined static array of float values called `VALUES`. This array represents values defining an interpolation motion which starts fast and slows down linearly towards the end. 

In the `FastOutLinearInInterpolator` constructor, these pre-defined values are passed to the parent class (`LookupTableInterpolator`) using the `super` keyword. 

This class is commonly used in animations where you want your animations to decelerate fast and then continue at a linear rate. The rate of change is fast in the beginning and then linear at the end. 

The file path comment at the end indicates that this class file is part of the AndroidX Interpolator library, which provides several interpolator classes for fine grained control over animation behaviour.
