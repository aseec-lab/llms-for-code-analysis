The `TransitionBuilder` class in the `androidx.constraintlayout.motion.widget` package provides functionality for building and validating transitions in a motion scene.

The `buildTransition()` function builds a new `MotionScene.Transition` object using given parameters, updates the `MotionScene` with the created transition and `ConstraintSet`s, and then returns the created transition.

The `updateConstraintSetInMotionScene()` function is a helper method that updates the start and end `ConstraintSet`s of a given transition in a `MotionScene`.

The `validate()` function checks the validity of the given `MotionLayout`. It throws a `RuntimeException` if the `MotionLayout` doesn't have a `MotionScene`, if the `MotionLayout` doesn't have the right `MotionScene`, or if the `MotionScene` doesn't have any transition.
