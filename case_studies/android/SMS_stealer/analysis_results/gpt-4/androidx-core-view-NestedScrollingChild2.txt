The `NestedScrollingChild2` interface in AndroidX extends the `NestedScrollingChild` interface and provides several methods to manage nested scrolling operations from the child view's side.

- `dispatchNestedPreScroll(int, int, int[], int[], int)`: This is called before a nested scroll event. The child can give its parent the chance to consume the scroll before it does.

- `dispatchNestedScroll(int, int, int, int, int[], int)`: This is called during a nested scroll. Continues to give the parent view the chance to consume the scroll.

- `hasNestedScrollingParent(int)`: This method checks if the nested scrolling operation has a parent.

- `startNestedScroll(int, int)`: A child view starts a nested scroll operation.

- `stopNestedScroll(int)`: This method stops a nested scroll operation from the child's perspective.

In short, the `NestedScrollingChild2` interface allows child views to interact with their parent view during nested scroll operations, including checking the presence of a parent, dispatching scroll events to the parent, and starting/stopping the nested scroll.
