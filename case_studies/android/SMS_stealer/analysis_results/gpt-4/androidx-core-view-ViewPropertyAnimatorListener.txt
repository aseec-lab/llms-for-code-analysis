The `ViewPropertyAnimatorListener` is an interface provided by the `androidx.core.view` package. It defines three methods that help handle different stages of a view property animation.

The `onAnimationStart(View paramView)` method is called at the start of the animation.

The `onAnimationEnd(View paramView)` method is called at the end of the animation.

The `onAnimationCancel(View paramView)` method is called when the animation is cancelled.

Each method accepts a `View` parameter, which signifies the view where the animation takes place. This interface lets you create classes that want to be notified by these animation events.
