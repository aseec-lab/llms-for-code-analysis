The `OkHttpResponseAndBitmapRequestListener` interface is also a part of the `com.androidnetworking.interfaces` package. It is designed to handle network requests and responses where the response needs to be handled as a `Bitmap`. It provides two methods:

1. `void onError(ANError paramANError);`: This method is called if any error occurs during the network request. The `paramANError` indicates details about the error.

2. `void onResponse(Response paramResponse, Bitmap paramBitmap);`: This method is triggered when a response is received for the network request. The `paramResponse` is the raw HTTP response from the OkHttp library and `paramBitmap` is the response body represented as a bitmap.

This interface is ideal for scenarios where you expect the network response to be an image that needs to be represented as a bitmap.
