The `MultipartStringBody` class is a simple Java object, representing a part of a Multipart body, that has two String fields: `contentType` and `value`.

- `contentType`: Content type of the body part.
- `value`: The actual content of the body part.

This class has a constructor accepting two parameters, `paramString1` and `paramString2`, which are used to initialize `value` and `contentType` respectively. 

An object of this class can be used to represent a string part in a Multipart HTTP request body.
