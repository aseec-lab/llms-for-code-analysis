`DialogTitle` is a class that extends the `AppCompatTextView` class. This class essentially represents the title of a dialog in an app that uses the AppCompat library. It provides three constructors for creating a `DialogTitle` object: one with just the `Context` parameter, one with `Context` and `AttributeSet` parameters, and one with `Context`, `AttributeSet`, and an integer parameter.

The method `onMeasure(int paramInt1, int paramInt2)` is overridden in this class. This method is called to measure the view and its content to determine the measured width and the measured height. If the title text exceeds one line, the class adjusts itself to allow for the text to be displayed in up to two lines. It is also re-measured to accommodate the changes mentioned.

The `DialogTitle` class is a part of the androidx AppCompat library, which provides backward-compatible versions of Android components.
