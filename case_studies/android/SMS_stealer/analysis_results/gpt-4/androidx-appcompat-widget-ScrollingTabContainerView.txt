The `ScrollingTabContainerView` class, a subclass of Android's `HorizontalScrollView`, is used to implement a horizontally scrolling set of tabs, typically seen in action bars. This class helps manage the collection of tabs and adding views for each tab to the scrollable tab container.

Here are some of the essential parts of its functionality:

- It defines several custom views for displaying tabs, a `TabView` for individual tabs, and a `TabAdapter` for providing views to the `Spinner` that's used when the tab set is collapsed.
  
- `createTabView(ActionBar.Tab paramTab, boolean paramBoolean)`: This function creates tab views for each tab.
  
- `addTab(ActionBar.Tab paramTab, int paramInt, boolean paramBoolean)` and `addTab(ActionBar.Tab paramTab, boolean paramBoolean)`: These functions add a tab to this container view at a specific position or at the end of the list.
  
- `removeTabAt(int paramInt)`: This function removes a tab from a certain position.
  
- `setTabSelected(int paramInt)`: This function sets the given tab as selected.
  
- `performCollapse()` and `performExpand()`: These two functions help in managing the collapsing and expanding of the tabs when there are more tabs than the view can display in its width.
  
- `animateToTab(int paramInt)`: This function provides smooth scrolling to the selected tab.

This class is specifically designed to work within a host view (`ActionBar`) and does not support being used outside of this context.The provided code expands the ScrollingTabContainerView class of Android's HorizontalScrollBar. It includes:

- `TabAdapter` that extends `BaseAdapter`: A custom adapter that is used to fill the scrolling tab with tab views.
  
- `TabClickListener` that implements `View.OnClickListener`: An on-click listener for each individual tab view. It selects the clicked tab and unselects all others.
  
- `TabView` that extends `LinearLayout`: A custom view for individual tabs. It updates the tab view when the bound tab (ActionBar.Tab) changes.
  
- `VisibilityAnimListener` that extends `AnimatorListenerAdapter`: This listener is used to detect visibility changes and apply animations correspondingly. It is able to cancel and finish animations and update the visibility when the animation ends. 

The remaining part of the program remains explaining the above classes more in depth and encompasses functionality for handling accessibility, measuring, setting and updating tabs, and animation.
