The `@NonNull` annotation indicates that a field, method return types, or parameters must not be null. This is a way to document a method or a variable that should never be null.

- `@Documented`: This is a marker annotation that means that whenever this annotation is used those elements should be documented using the Javadoc tool. In short, it indicates that any use of the `@NonNull` annotation should be recorded in the generated documentation.

- `@Retention(RetentionPolicy.CLASS)`: This means that the `@NonNull` annotation need not be retained at runtime. It's stored in the class file during compilation and removed during runtime.

- `@Target`: This specifies the types of elements to which the annotation can be applied. In this case, it can be applied to methods, parameters, fields, local variables, other annotations, and packages.

The comment at the end of the code appears to be metadata or a footprint left by the decompiler (JD-Core Version: 1.1.3). It does not affect the functionality of the `@NonNull` annotation.
