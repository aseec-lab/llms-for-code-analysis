The `Settings` class in package okhttp3.internal.http2 holds configurations for Http/2 protocol's settings. 

HTTP/2 allows peers to communicate settings related to the Http2 connection. Each setting is an ID/value pair.

The class contains several fields to specify each setting, each setting is a static integer value.
 
The `values[]` array holds the current value for the setting associated with each index.
 
The `set` variable is used to track which settings' values are set.

The `get` methods extract information about specific settings, applying bit operations on the `set` integer and returning default values if the setting has not yet been set.

The `merge` method merges multiple settings and applies new settings if they are set.

The `set` method sets a specific setting to a specific value, updating both `set` and `values[]` fields as necessary.

The `isSet` and `size` methods provide information about which settings have been set and how many settings are set respectively.

The `clear` method resets all the settings.
