The `Until` annotation is a feature in the Gson library that indicates a field or type should be ignored from serialization or deserialization from a specified version number onwards. 

- This annotation can be applied to fields and classes.

- The `value` field is a mandatory field and is the version number from which the corresponding field or class should start getting ignored.

- `@Retention(RetentionPolicy.RUNTIME)`: This Java annotation indicates that the `Until` annotation should be kept at runtime by the JVM, enabling Gson to access it.

- `@Target({ElementType.FIELD, ElementType.TYPE})` specifies that this annotation can be used with fields and types (classes, interfaces, etc.).

- `@Documented` is a marker annotation indicating that whenever the `Until` annotation is used those elements should be documented using the Javadoc tool.  This means that instruction or information about how to use the `Until` annotation can be included in the project's generated documentation.
