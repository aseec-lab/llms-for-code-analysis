The `DownloadProgressListener` interface is part of the `com.androidnetworking.interfaces` package. It is designed to monitor the progress of a download operation.

This interface has a single method:

 - `void onProgress(long paramLong1, long paramLong2);`: This method is invoked to indicate the progress of the download operation. The `paramLong1` represents the number of bytes downloaded so far, and `paramLong2` represents the total size of the file being downloaded.

This way, by implementing this method, we can keep a track of how much of the file has been downloaded and use this information according to our needs (like updating a progress bar on UI, etc.).
