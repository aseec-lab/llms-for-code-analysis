The `AppCompatSeekBarHelper` class is a helper class for customizing the SeekBar in Android, specifically for earlier versions where certain features weren't available. Some of the main usages and functionalities of the class include:

- Managing the visual look of SeekBar including the tint color and tint mode of tick marks.
- Handling loading of attributes from XML layout files.
- Assisting in drawing tick marks in relation to the progress of the SeekBar.
- Adjusting drawable state and layout direction to support RTL (Right-To-Left) languages.
- Saving the state of drawables.
- Getting and setting the drawable and color state list for the tick mark, and the tint mode for the SeekBar.
- The class extends `AppCompatProgressBarHelper`, inheriting its features and capabilities, and applies appcompat styles and attributes to SeekBar. The helper is used in the `AppCompatSeekBar` class where it is initialized and its methods are utilized.
