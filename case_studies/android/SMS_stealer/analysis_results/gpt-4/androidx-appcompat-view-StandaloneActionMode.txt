The `StandaloneActionMode` class is a subclass of `ActionMode` and implements `MenuBuilder.Callback`. This class acts as a standalone mode in the user interface, often as an alternative action bar to perform actions related to data in an app. It is used to perform long-duration, e.g. selection-based, operations.

Key methods include:

- `finish()`: Finishes the action mode and notifies the callback.
- `getCustomView()`: Returns the custom view set in the action mode.
- `getMenu()`: Returns the menu used with this action mode.
- `getMenuInflater()`: Returns a `MenuInflater` to inflate menu items.
- `getSubtitle()`: Returns the subtitle of this action mode.
- `getTitle()`: Returns the title of this action mode.
- `invalidate()`: Invalidates the action mode and signals that the data may have changed.
- `onMenuItemSelected()`: Handles menu item selection.
- `onMenuModeChange()`: Called when a menu mode has been changed.
- `setCustomView()`: Sets a custom view for this action mode.
- `setSubtitle()`: Sets the subtitle of this action mode.

The class also has a few private instance variables such as `mContext`, `mContextView`, `mMenu` and several others that are used to maintain the state and settings of the standalone action mode.
