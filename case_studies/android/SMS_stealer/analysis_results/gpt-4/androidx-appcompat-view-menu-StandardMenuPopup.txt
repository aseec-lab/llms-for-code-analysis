The `StandardMenuPopup` class in the `androidx.appcompat.view.menu` package is a concrete implementation of a `MenuPopup`. It's used to present a menu in a standard popup window. The menu items are typically inflated from a layout resource defined in XML.

Key methods in this class:
- `StandardMenuPopup`: Creates a new instance of the `StandardMenuPopup`, setting up the initial configuration.
- `tryShow`: Attempts to show the menu popup, returns true if successful.
- `dismiss`: Closes the popup if it's currently showing.
- `isShowing`: Checks whether the popup is currently being displayed.
- `getListView`: Gets the `ListView` where the menu items are displayed.
- `onDismiss`: Handles the dismissing of the popup.
- `onKey`: Handles key events when a key is pressed. Dismisses if key code is KEYCODE_MENU (82).
- `setAnchorView`, `setCallback`, `setForceShowIcon`, `setGravity`, `setHorizontalOffset`, `setOnDismissListener`, `setShowTitle`, `setVerticalOffset`: Configuration methods to set various properties for the popup.
- `show`: Tries to show the popup, throws an `IllegalStateException` if unsuccessful.
- `updateMenuView`: Forces an update/re-measurement of the popup menu's content width. This is often called after dataset changes.
