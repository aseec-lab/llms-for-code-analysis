The provided Java code represents a `VelocityTrackerCompat` class that is declared as deprecated in the androidx.core.view package. This class has two static methods: `getXVelocity()` and `getYVelocity()`. Both methods take a `VelocityTracker` object and an integer as parameters.

The methods `getXVelocity()` and `getYVelocity()` are basically wrapper methods around the `VelocityTracker`'s `getXVelocity(int)` and `getYVelocity(int)` methods respectively. These methods allow you to retrieve the velocity of the tracked movement along the X or Y axis in pixels per second. 

The purpose of declaring them deprecated in this class seems to suggest clients that they should now directly use these methods from the `VelocityTracker` class itself.
