The `MethodCallsLogger` class is a utility class in Android's Lifecycle library. It maintains a `Map`, `mCalledMethods`, where the keys are method names and the values are integers. 

It has one public method, `approveCall(String paramString, int paramInt)`, which checks if a particular method (represented by `paramString`) has been called (tracked by checking if `paramInt` bit is set in the corresponding map value). If the method has been called, it returns false; otherwise, it updates the map to indicate the method is now called and returns true.

This class can help prevent redundant lifecycle method calls or to track method calls order and frequency in the lifecycle of an Android component like Activity or Fragment.
