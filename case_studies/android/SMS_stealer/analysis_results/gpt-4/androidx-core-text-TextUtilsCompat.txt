`TextUtilsCompat` is a utility class that provides compatibility methods for text related operations with older versions of Android.

- `getLayoutDirectionFromFirstChar(Locale paramLocale)`: Private method. It returns the layout direction based on the first character of the display name of the locale. It uses the `Character.getDirectionality()` method. If the directionality is either `RIGHT_TO_LEFT` or `RIGHT_TO_LEFT_ARABIC` (`1` and `2`), it returns `1`, otherwise `0`.

- `getLayoutDirectionFromLocale(Locale paramLocale)`: If the API level is 17 or higher, it uses the native `TextUtils.getLayoutDirectionFromLocale()` method. For lower API levels, it checks if the locale is not null and not equal to `ROOT`. Then it uses the `ICUCompat.maximizeAndGetScript()` method to get the script of the locale. If the script is `Arab` or `Hebr`, it returns `1`. If no script is found, it calls `getLayoutDirectionFromFirstChar()`. If the locale is `ROOT` or null, it returns `0` (indicating left-to-right layout).

- `htmlEncode(String paramString)`: Encodes special HTML characters in a string with their corresponding HTML entities. If the API level is 17 or higher, it uses the native method `TextUtils.htmlEncode()`. Otherwise, it processes each character in the string and replaces it with the corresponding HTML entity.
   
These methods are used to support internationalization and localization in an application, and the encoding of texts to be correctly displayed in an HTML context.
