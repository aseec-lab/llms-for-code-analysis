The `ContainerHelpers` is a utility class used in the AndroidX Collection package. It provides several useful static methods and constant variables used for managing container-like data structures.

Key elements:

1. `EMPTY_INTS`, `EMPTY_LONGS`, `EMPTY_OBJECTS`: These are empty arrays of `int`, `long`, and `Object` types respectively, potentially used as default values.

2. `binarySearch(int[] paramArrayOfint, int paramInt1, int paramInt2)`, `binarySearch(long[] paramArrayOflong, int paramInt, long paramLong)`: These methods implement a binary search algorithm for arrays of `int` and `long` types respectively. They return the index of the target element if found or `(insertion point) ^ -1` if not found.

3. `equal(Object paramObject1, Object paramObject2)`: This method checks if two Objects are equal. It compares objects by reference and by invoking the `equals()` method to compare their content.

4. `idealByteArraySize(int paramInt)`: This method calculates an ideal byte array size that is larger than or equal to the requested size, adjusted to decrease memory fragmentation.

5. `idealIntArraySize(int paramInt)`, `idealLongArraySize(int paramInt)`: These methods calculate the ideal `int` or `long` array size respectively, based on the given parameter. They make use of the `idealByteArraySize` method for calculation.
