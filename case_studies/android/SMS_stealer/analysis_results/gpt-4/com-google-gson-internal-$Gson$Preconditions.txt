The `$Gson$Preconditions` is a utility class that has helper methods for checking conditions that must be true.

- The constructor is made private and throws `UnsupportedOperationException`, making it impossible to instantiate the class. This is a common pattern for utility or helper classes.

- The `checkArgument(boolean paramBoolean)` method takes a boolean value as an argument. If the argument is false, it throws an `IllegalArgumentException`. This is typically used for checking method arguments.

- The `checkNotNull(T paramT)` method takes an argument of generic type `T` and returns it if it's not null. If the argument is null, it throws a `NullPointerException`. This is used to check if an object is not null before using it.

The methods presented can be used to enforce coding constraints or prevent invalid scenarios. The class is named in such a manner (`$Gson$Preconditions`) to suggest that it is intended for internal use by the Gson library.
