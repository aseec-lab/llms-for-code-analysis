This class `ParseUtil` is a utility in the Android Networking library for managing parsers.

The class has a single private static member `mParserFactory` which is of type `Parser.Factory`.

In the `getParserFactory()` method, it checks whether `mParserFactory` is null or not. If it's null, a new `GsonParserFactory` is created and assigned to `mParserFactory`.

The `setParserFactory(Parser.Factory paramFactory)` method is provided to set a new Parser Factory. User-defined Parser Factory can be set using this method.

The `shutDown()` method simply sets `mParserFactory` to null, presumably as a way to clean up resources when the parser is no longer needed.
