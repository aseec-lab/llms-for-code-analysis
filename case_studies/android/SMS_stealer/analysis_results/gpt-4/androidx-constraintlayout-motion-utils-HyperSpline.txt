The `HyperSpline` class is used for managing smooth transitions in multi-dimensional spaces using cubic splines. 

- The `mCtl` 2D array stores the control points. 
- The `mCurve` 2D array stores a set of `Cubic` objects for each dimension. 
- The `mCurveLength` array holds the approximate length of each curve segment and `mTotalLength` is the sum of all these lengths.
- The constructor `HyperSpline(double[][] paramArrayOfdouble)` initializes the object by calling the `setup` method.
- The `setup` method populates the details of all cubic curves (i.e., control points, approximate lengths).
- The `getPos` methods get the position on the curve by taking a fraction of total length and an array to store the resulting point.
- The `calcNaturalCubic` static method creates and returns an array of Cubic curves for a set of points in one dimension.
- The `approxLength` method returns the approximate length of the cubic curve.
- There's an inner static class `Cubic` used for cubic polynomial representation and operations like evaluation of the polynomial at a certain point and computation of velocity.
