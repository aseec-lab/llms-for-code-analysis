The `Streams` class provides several methods for working with JSON:

- `parse(JsonReader paramJsonReader)` method reads a `JsonReader` object and converts it into a `JsonElement`.
- `write(JsonElement paramJsonElement, JsonWriter paramJsonWriter)` method writes a `JsonElement` to a `JsonWriter`.
- `writerForAppendable(Appendable paramAppendable)` method returns a `Writer` that can append to the provided `Appendable` object.

The `AppendableWriter` inner class extends `Writer` and is used to append data to an `Appendable` object. 

The `CurrentWrite` inner class implements the `CharSequence` interface and represents a sequence of characters, which are used in the `AppendableWriter`.

It should be noted that all these features are marked as obsolete and should not be used, based on the deprecation comments.
