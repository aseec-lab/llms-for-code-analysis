This code is part of the `AppCompatTextHelper` class in the AndroidX AppCompat library. The class helps apply various text styles, attributes and effects to a `TextView` widget. Attributes such as font family, font size, text style, and compound drawable tints can be set. 

This code includes methods to apply tint to compound drawables, set compound drawables, and set tint information. It also includes methods to adjust auto-size text properties. This class is also responsible for handling the functionality related to the TextAppearance attributes in XML, such as text styles, typeface, and font weight. 

There are also methods to retrieve various auto size properties, compound drawable tint list and mode. Moreover, there's an asynchronous font retrieval handling for API 28 and above, with fallback procedure for lower APIs. 

Instances of this class can be attached to a `TextView`, providing added capabilities and enlarging the `TextView`'s property set.This snippet continues from the previous one and is still part of the `AppCompatTextHelper` class. It primarily defines the `loadFromAttributes` method where drawable and text style attributes for a `TextView` are parsed and set. It handles customising these attributes both from XML layouts as well as programmatically. 

Other methods in the snippet include checking if the auto-size text feature is enabled, loading typeface from the text appearance, setting various compound drawable properties, handling layout changes by auto-sizing the text, setting 'All Caps' property for the text, and various other setter methods for auto-size text configurations. 

It also has methods for setting the tint (color effect applied to a drawable) for compound drawables (Drawable images set next to the text in a TextView), and the method `setAllCaps` that controls whether the text should be displayed in ALL CAPS mode or not. Additionally, it includes a method (`onAsyncTypefaceReceived`) that handles setting typeface when it is received asynchronously. 

Lastly, it contains layout methods (`onLayout`, `onSetCompoundDrawables`, `onSetTextAppearance`) to arrange and present the TextView with the given attributes and settings.This part of the code includes a method to set the text size for the TextView. It checks if auto-size is disabled before setting the text size. The block of text at the end is metadata related to the source location and version of the `AppCompatTextHelper` java class.
