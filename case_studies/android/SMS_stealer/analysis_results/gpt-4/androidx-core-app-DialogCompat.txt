The `DialogCompat` class in the `androidx.core.app` package provides compatibility features for working with `Dialog` objects between different versions of Android. 

It includes a method called `requireViewById()`. This method retrieves a `View` within a `Dialog` by its ID. If the Android API version is 28 or higher, it directly uses the `requireViewById()` method from the `Dialog` class. 

For lower Android versions, it uses the `findViewById()` method. If the specified ID does not correspond to a `View` inside the `Dialog`, it throws an `IllegalArgumentException`.
