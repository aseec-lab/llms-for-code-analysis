The `TooltipCompat` class is a compatibility class within the AndroidX AppCompat library. It provides a static method `setTooltipText(View paramView, CharSequence paramCharSequence)` to set a tooltip text for a view. It's used to display some information about a particular view when a user hovers over it.

The method checks the Android OS version. If it's 26 (Android 8.0 Oreo) or higher, it uses the built-in `setTooltipText` method of the `View` class. If it's lower, it uses a custom handler (`TooltipCompatHandler.setTooltipText`) from `TooltipCompatHandler` class to display the tooltip text. 

This provides backward compatibility for apps that are still targeting lower Android OS versions while also utilizing newer features for those on newer Android OS versions.
