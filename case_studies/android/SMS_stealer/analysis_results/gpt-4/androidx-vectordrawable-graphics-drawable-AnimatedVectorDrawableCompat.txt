This is part of the `AnimatedVectorDrawableCompat` class, which is a key class in the VectorDrawable library. 

The class extends `VectorDrawableCommon` and implements `Animatable2Compat`. It provides both static and instance methods for creating and managing animations for vector drawables. 

Static methods include `clearAnimationCallbacks`, `create`, `createFromXmlInner`, `registerAnimationCallback`, and `unregisterAnimationCallback`.

Instance methods include animation management methods such as `applyTheme`, `canApplyTheme`, `clearAnimationCallbacks`, `getAlpha`, `getChangingConfigurations`, `getColorFilter`, `getConstantState`, `getIntrinsicHeight`, `getIntrinsicWidth`, `getOpacity`, and `inflate`.

The class also defines instance variables such as `mAnimatedVectorState`, `mAnimationCallbacks`, `mAnimatorListener`, `mArgbEvaluator`, `mCachedConstantStateDelegate`, `mCallback` and `mContext`.

Primarily, this class provides the ability to animate vector drawables, register and unregister animation callbacks and handle XML inflation of vector drawables. It also provides abilities to handle changes in configurations and themes.The remaining part of the code describes several methods of the `AnimatedVectorDrawableCompat` class:

1. `isAutoMirrored`: Returns whether the drawable's mirroring is automatically enabled for end-users of RTL (right to left) languages.

2. `isRunning`: Check if the animation is currently running.

3. `isStateful`: Checks whether the drawable has a state.

4. `mutate`: Returns an instance of the drawable that's separate from other drawables.

5. `onBoundsChange`: Updates the drawable's bounds.

6. `onLevelChange`: Modifies the level of the drawable.

7. `onStateChange`: Modifies the drawable's array of states.

8. `registerAnimationCallback`: Registers a callback to be invoked when the animation starts or ends.

9. `setAlpha`: Sets the alpha value of the drawable.

10. `setAutoMirrored`: Defines if the drawable should be mirrored for RTL languages.

11. `setColorFilter`: Applies a color filter to the drawable.

12. `setTint` and `setTintList`: Applies a tint to the drawable.

13. `setTintMode`: Sets the blending mode.

14. `setVisible`: Makes the drawable visible or invisible.

15. `start`, `stop`: Methods to control the animation.

16. `unregisterAnimationCallback`: Unregisters a previously registered callback.

Additionally, it introduces two private classes, `AnimatedVectorDrawableCompatState` and `AnimatedVectorDrawableDelegateState`, each extending `Drawable.ConstantState`. They are internal classes used for instantiating new drawables and keeping the state of the drawable.
