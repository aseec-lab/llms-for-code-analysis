This code represents the `DependencyNode` class, which is a potential dependency in calculation of layout constraints in an Android application.

Key features of this class include:

1. `dependencies`: A List of `Dependency` objects that this `DependencyNode` depends upon to be resolved.

2. `addDependency(Dependency paramDependency)`: Method to add a `Dependency` to the list of dependencies. If the current node is already resolved, it triggers the `update` method on the new `Dependency`.

3. `clear()`: Method to clear all dependencies and targets and reset relevant fields to their default states.

4. `resolve(int paramInt)`: Method to resolve the `DependencyNode` with a specified value, provided the node is not already resolved.

5. `update(Dependency paramDependency)`: Method to update the `DependencyNode` state based on the status of its targets.

6. `Type` enum: An enum representing the potential types of `DependencyNode`, which could be referring to different types of layout properties (for example, LEFT, RIGHT, TOP, and BOTTOM).

This `DependencyNode` class is used by a `WidgetRun` object to represent potential constraints that need to be resolved in order to determine the layout of a widget in ConstraintLayout.
