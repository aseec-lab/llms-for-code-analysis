The `InterpolatorRes` annotation in Android is used to denote that the integer parameter, field, local variable, or method return type should represent an Interpolator resource reference. An Interpolator defines the rate of change of an animation. This annotation helps in correctly associating integer values with the corresponding resource in the project.

The `@Retention(RetentionPolicy.CLASS)` annotation indicates that this annotation will be recorded in the compiled .class file but will be ignored at runtime. The `@Target` annotation specifies that this annotation can be used with method declarations, parameters, fields, and local variables. The `@Documented` annotation indicates that elements annotated with `InterpolatorRes` should be documented using the Javadoc tool.
