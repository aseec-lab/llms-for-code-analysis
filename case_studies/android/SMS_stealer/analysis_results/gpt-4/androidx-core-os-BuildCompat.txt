The `BuildCompat` class checks the Android OS version that the app is running on. It provides various methods, each of which checks if the device's operating system is at least a certain API level. It has the following methods:

- `isAtLeastN()`: Checks if the device is running on Android N (API level 24) or higher.

- `isAtLeastNMR1()`: Checks if the device is running on Android N MR1 (API level 25) or higher.

- `isAtLeastO()`: Checks if the device is running on Android O (API level 26) or higher.

- `isAtLeastOMR1()`: Checks if the device is running on Android O MR1 (API level 27) or higher.

- `isAtLeastP()`: Checks if the device is running on Android P (API level 28) or higher.

- `isAtLeastQ()`: Checks if the device is running on Android Q (API level 29) or higher.

- `isAtLeastR()`: Checks if the device is running on Android R (API level 30) or higher.

These methods return `true` if the device's OS is at least the specified version and `false` otherwise. Note that these methods are deprecated since checking OS version at runtime is not recommended. Instead, feature detection should be used where possible.
