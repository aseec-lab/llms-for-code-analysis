This class, `TouchResponse`, handles the touch inputs for a `MotionLayout`. The touch behaviors are described by a variety of attributes selected from XML and handled from within the `fillFromAttributeList` and `fill` methods. It also remembers the last touch position (`mLastTouchX` and `mLastTouchY`), overcomes the drag threshold (`mDragThreshold`), and calculates motion progress (`getProgressDirection` method). 

Moreover, it calculates speed of swipes (`processTouchEvent` method), boundary limits (`getLimitBoundsTo` method) and also manages the motion of widgets during a touch event. It contains various touch direction and side properties, which help in determining the behavior of motion in response to touch events.This section of the `TouchResponse` class contains methods that handle various touch behaviors. 

`scrollMove` updates the progress of the motion layout while scrolling. 

`scrollUp` handles the action performed when scrolling stops. 

`setAnchorId` sets the Anchor ID. 

`setDown` records the initial touch (down) position. 

`setMaxAcceleration` and `setMaxVelocity` set the maximum acceleration and velocity respectively. 

`setRTL` adjusts the direction of touch movement based on the layout direction (left-to-right or right-to-left). 

`setTouchAnchorLocation` sets the location for the touch anchor. 

`setUpTouchEvent` records the position where a touch event ends. 

`setupTouch` sets touch listeners for `NestedScrollView`, if the anchor view is `NestedScrollView`. 

`toString` provides a string representation for touch direction.
