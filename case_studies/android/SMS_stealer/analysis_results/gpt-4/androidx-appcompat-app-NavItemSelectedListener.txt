The `NavItemSelectedListener` class implements `AdapterView.OnItemSelectedListener`, providing a way to listen for when an item in a navigation dropdown is selected within action bar. 

The class has a constructor that takes an `ActionBar.OnNavigationListener` as the argument which is then utilized in `onItemSelected` method. When an item is selected in the navigation dropdown, it invokes `onNavigationItemSelected` method on the listener, passing the index position of the selected item and its row id. 

The `onNothingSelected` method is also implemented but it's left empty, indicating no specific functionality is intended when no item is selected in the navigation dropdown.
