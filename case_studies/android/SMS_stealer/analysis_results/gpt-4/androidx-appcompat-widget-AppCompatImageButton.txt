The `AppCompatImageButton` class extends the `ImageButton` class and implements the `TintableBackgroundView` and `TintableImageSourceView` interfaces. It's a part of the `AppCompat` library, which is a set of components that provide backward compatibility for Android UI controls and features.

This class provides additional features such as the ability to apply image and background tints.

1. `AppCompatImageButton` maintains two helper objects of type `AppCompatBackgroundHelper` and `AppCompatImageHelper`. These helpers are used to apply tints and handle the image/button states, like for drawable state changes.

2. The `drawableStateChanged` method ensures that when the state of the drawable changes, the correct tint is applied according to the new state.

3. The `getSupportBackgroundTintList`, `getSupportBackgroundTintMode`, `getSupportImageTintList`, and `getSupportImageTintMode` methods return the currently applied tints.

4. The `hasOverlappingRendering` checks if the image/button has overlapping rending; it's the combination of the button's own overlapping rendering and that of the image helper.

5. The `setBackgroundDrawable`, `setBackgroundResource`, `setImageBitmap`, `setImageDrawable`, `setImageResource`, and `setImageURI` methods allow setting the image or background of the button, and ensure the correct tint is applied when these properties change.

6. The `setSupportBackgroundTintList`, `setSupportBackgroundTintMode`, `setSupportImageTintList`, and `setSupportImageTintMode` methods provide a way to set the tints that should be used.

This class is beneficial for providing consistent UI behavior and appearance across various Android OS versions.
