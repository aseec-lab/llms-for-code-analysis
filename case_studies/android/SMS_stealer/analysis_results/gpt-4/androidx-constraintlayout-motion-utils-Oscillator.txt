The `Oscillator` class is used to represent oscillating values, like sine waves or cosine waves. It can represent several types of oscillation such as, sine wave (`SIN_WAVE`), square wave (`SQUARE_WAVE`), triangle wave (`TRIANGLE_WAVE`), saw wave (`SAW_WAVE`), reverse saw wave (`REVERSE_SAW_WAVE`), or cosine wave (`COS_WAVE`).

The oscillation can be customized by adding points with specific period via the `addPoint` method. The period and positions are stored in arrays `mPeriod` and `mPosition` respectively. The class also uses an `mArea` array to aid in normalization.

Normalization of the oscillation can be performed through the `normalize` method, which adjusts the periods so the integral of the function equals the total range of the function.

The value and slope at any given point in the oscillation can be obtained through `getValue` and `getSlope` methods respectively. The type of oscillation will determine the calculation of these values.

Finally, the `setType` method can be used to set the type of oscillation the `Oscillator` object should represent.
