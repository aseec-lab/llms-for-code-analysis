`ScaleGestureDetectorCompat` is a helper class in AndroidX's Core library that provides static methods to interact with `ScaleGestureDetector` instances. It provides compatibility support for newer Android features across different Android OS versions.

The main methods in this class are:

1. `isQuickScaleEnabled(ScaleGestureDetector paramScaleGestureDetector)`: Returns true if quick scale gesture is enabled in the provided `ScaleGestureDetector` instance, for Android versions 19 and above. Otherwise, it returns false.

2. `isQuickScaleEnabled(Object paramObject)`: An older, deprecated version of the above method, which accepts a generic Object as parameter.

3. `setQuickScaleEnabled(ScaleGestureDetector paramScaleGestureDetector, boolean paramBoolean)`: Enables or disables quick scale gesture on the provided `ScaleGestureDetector` instance, applicable for Android versions 19 and above.

4. `setQuickScaleEnabled(Object paramObject, boolean paramBoolean)`: An older, deprecated version of the above method, which accepts a generic Object and a boolean as parameters.

The class ensures that the correct methods are called depending on the API level of the device the application is running on. In other words, it cares about backward compatibility.
