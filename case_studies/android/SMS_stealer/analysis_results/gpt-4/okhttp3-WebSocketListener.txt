The `WebSocketListener` is an abstract class provided by the OkHttp library and is used as a callback for WebSocket events. It defines several empty methods which can be overridden to react to different events:

- `onOpen(WebSocket, Response)`: This method is called when a WebSocket connection has been accepted by the remote peer.

- `onMessage(WebSocket, String)`: This method is called for each string message received by the WebSocket.

- `onMessage(WebSocket, ByteString)`: This method is called for each binary message received by the WebSocket.

- `onClosing(WebSocket, int, String)`: This method is called when the remote peer has initiated a graceful shutdown of the WebSocket connection.

- `onClosed(WebSocket, int, String)`: This method is called when the WebSocket has been closed.

- `onFailure(WebSocket, Throwable, Response)`: This method is called if an error has occurred with the WebSocket connection or protocol. 

The specific implementation of these methods depends on the specifics of your application and how you intend to handle WebSocket events.
