The `DecorContentParent` is an interface that provides several methods for controlling the appearance and behavior of content within a decorated window.

These include being able to:
- Show or hide the overflow menu.
- Check if the overflow menu is showing or pending.
- Handle icons and logos.
- Get the title.
- Initiate features.
- Restore and save toolbar state.
- Set icons, logo, menu, UI options, window callback and title.

It lets you adjust the visual elements in the window's decor such as the action bar, overflow menu and so on. It's used within the appcompat library to consistent look and feel across different versions of Android.
