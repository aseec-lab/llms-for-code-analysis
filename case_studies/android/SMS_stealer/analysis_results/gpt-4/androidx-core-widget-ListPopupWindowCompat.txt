The `ListPopupWindowCompat` class in the AndroidX Core library provides compatibility methods for `ListPopupWindow`. 

1. `createDragToOpenListener(ListPopupWindow paramListPopupWindow, View paramView)`: It creates and returns a touch listener that opens the `ListPopupWindow` when the trigger view is dragged. The implementation relies on the API level. For API level 19 and above, it delegates the call to the `ListPopupWindow`. If the API level is below 19, it returns null, implying that this feature is not supported.

2. `createDragToOpenListener(Object paramObject, View paramView)`: This method is deprecated. It serves the same purpose as the first method but accepts any `Object` as the first parameter, which is then cast to a `ListPopupWindow`. This method delegates to `createDragToOpenListener(ListPopupWindow paramListPopupWindow, View paramView)`.
