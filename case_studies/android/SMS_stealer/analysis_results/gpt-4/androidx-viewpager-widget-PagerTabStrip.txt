The `PagerTabStrip` is a widget that provides a horizontal interactive indicator of the current, previous, and next pages of a ViewPager. It is designed to be used as a child view of a ViewPager widget in XML layout.

Some of the key classes, methods and variables include:

1. `mTabPaint`: Paint object for drawing tabs.

2. `mTempRect`: Temporary rectangle to get global visible rect.

3. `mIndicatorColor`: Color for the indicator line on the current page.

4. `mIndicatorHeight`: Height for the indicator line on the current page.

5. `mTabAlpha`: Alpha value of the color for the tab indicator.

6. `mDrawFullUnderline`: A flag determining whether to draw a full width underline.

7. `getDrawFullUnderline()`: Returns the value of the variable mDrawFullUnderline.

8. `getMinHeight()`: Computes the minimum height of the view based on the MIN_HEIGHT and the height of the parent view.

9. `getTabIndicatorColor()`: Returns the value of the variable mTabIndicatorColor.

10. `onDraw(Canvas paramCanvas)`: Called to draw the visual representation of the tabs. This method will draw the indicator line below the current tab and, if enabled, a full-width underline.

11. `onTouchEvent(MotionEvent paramMotionEvent)`: This method is called when a touch screen motion event occurs. It handles clicks on the tabs to switch the current page.

12. `setBackgroundColor(int paramInt)`, `setBackgroundDrawable(Drawable paramDrawable)`, and `setBackgroundResource(int paramInt)`: These methods set the background of the `PagerTabStrip`.

13. `setTabIndicatorColor(int paramInt)` and `setTabIndicatorColorResource(int paramInt)`: These methods set the tab indicator color.

14. `setTextSpacing(int paramInt)`: This method sets the space between the text of each tab title.

15. `updateTextPositions(int paramInt, float paramFloat, boolean paramBoolean)`: This method updates the positions of the text when the user scrolls through pages.

This widget makes it easy to implement a pattern of horizontal scrolling between sibling screens. Users can either swipe the content area itself or click on the tabs to navigate between pages.
