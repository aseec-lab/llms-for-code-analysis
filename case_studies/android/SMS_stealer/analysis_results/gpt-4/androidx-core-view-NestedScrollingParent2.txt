The `NestedScrollingParent2` interface in AndroidX extends the `NestedScrollingParent` interface, providing a set of callback methods used to manage nested scrolling operations.

- `onNestedPreScroll(View, int, int, int[], int)`: This method gets called before the nested scrolling child consumes the scroll distance itself. This allows the parent to consume some or all of the scroll operation before the child view does.

- `onNestedScroll(View, int, int, int, int, int)`: This is called when a nested scrolling child is actively scrolling, and the nested scroll has already been consumed by the nested scrolling child.

- `onNestedScrollAccepted(View, View, int, int)`: This is called when a nested scrolling child view accepts a start of a nested scroll operation.

- `onStartNestedScroll(View, View, int, int)`: This method gets called when a nested scrolling child requests to start a nested scroll.

- `onStopNestedScroll(View, int)`: This method is called when a nested scroll is ending.

Overall, this interface allows parent views to monitor the nested scroll operations taking place within the child views.
