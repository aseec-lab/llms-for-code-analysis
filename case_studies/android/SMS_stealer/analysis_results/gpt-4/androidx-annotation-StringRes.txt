`StringRes` is an annotation from the AndroidX library. It's used to indicate that an `int` parameter, field or method return value is expected to be a String resource reference (e.g., `R.string.some_string`). 

The annotation helps to ensure that valid string references are provided where required, thus helping to prevent bugs and crashes.

The `@Retention(RetentionPolicy.CLASS)` indicates to the Java compiler to keep the annotation in the compiled class file but not require it at runtime.

The `@Target` annotation indicates that this annotation can be used on methods, parameters, fields or local variables.

From the footer note, it seems this file was decompiled from a jar file (dex2jar.jar), likely coded in Java 6 and then decompiled using JD-Core version 1.1.3. So, the code you are examining is likely reverse engineered byte code, not the original source code.
