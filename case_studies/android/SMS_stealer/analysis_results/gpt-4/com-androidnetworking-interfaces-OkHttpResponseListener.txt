The `OkHttpResponseListener` interface is part of the `com.androidnetworking.interfaces` package and it's designed to handle the result of an HTTP operation. This interface has two methods:

- `void onError(ANError paramANError);`: This method is invoked when there is an error during the HTTP operation. The `paramANError` parameter is an object of type `ANError` that contains detailed information about the error.

- `void onResponse(Response paramResponse);`: This method is invoked when the HTTP operation is successful. The `paramResponse` parameter is an object of type `Response` from the OkHttp library that contains the HTTP response from the server.

This interface can be implemented by any class that needs to handle the results of an HTTP operation. These methods would contain the specific logic to handle a successful response or an error.
