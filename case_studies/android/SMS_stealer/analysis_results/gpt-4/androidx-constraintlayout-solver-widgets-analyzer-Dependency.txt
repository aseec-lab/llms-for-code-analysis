The `Dependency` interface is a part of the solver for the ConstraintLayout in Android. It defines a single method `update()` which takes another `Dependency` as an argument. Classes that implement this interface should provide the logic for updating the state based on the dependency.

However, without the implementation of the `update()` method, it is hard to speculate on what the method exactly does. Generally, in the context of ConstraintLayout and its solver, the `Dependency` probably represents constraints or relationships amongst widgets that must be resolved or updated when layout calculations occur.
