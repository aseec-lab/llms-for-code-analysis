The `PathUtils` class exposes two static methods used for simplifying an Android `Path` into a collection of `PathSegment`s. It uses the `approximate(float)` method of `Path` which approximates the `Path` through a series of line segments. These line segments can be thought of as a polyline that closely approximates the `Path`.

1. `public static Collection<PathSegment> flatten(Path paramPath)`: This method is a convenience method that works as an alias for `flatten(Path, 0.5F)`. It accepts a `Path` instance, and returns the flattened path segments up to a maximum error of `0.5f`.

2. `public static Collection<PathSegment> flatten(Path paramPath, float paramFloat)`: This method accepts a `Path` instance and a maximum error. It then uses these parameters to obtain an approximation of the `Path`. The method then iterates this array, creating `PointF` instances representing the start and end of each line segment, as well as the fraction of time at which the segment starts and ends. It adds a new instance of PathSegment to an `ArrayList` at each iteration. This `ArrayList` is then returned as the result. The resulting list of `PathSegment`s should closely match the original `Path` within the specified error.
