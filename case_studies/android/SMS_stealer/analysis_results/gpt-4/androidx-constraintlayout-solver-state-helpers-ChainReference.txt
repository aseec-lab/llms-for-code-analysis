The `ChainReference` class extends `HelperReference` and it provides functionalities to manipulate chains in Android's ConstraintLayout. A chain is a group of widgets that are linked to each other bi-directionally.

The highlights of this class are:

- `mBias` (default is 0.5F): This variable is used to adjust the distribution of space among the widgets in the chain.

- `mStyle` (default is `State.Chain.SPREAD`): This represents the style of the chain. 

In the class:

- In the constructor `ChainReference()`, a `State` and `State.Helper` objects are passed as parameters.

- `bias(float paramFloat)`: This method assigns the distribution of the space among the widgets in the chain.

- `getBias()`: This method returns the current chain bias.

- `getStyle()`: This method returns the current chain style.

- `style(State.Chain paramChain)`: This method permits to change the style of the chain.
