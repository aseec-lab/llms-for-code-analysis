The `JsonSyntaxException` is a custom exception class in the Gson library. It extends the `JsonParseException` class, inheriting its properties and methods. This exception is thrown when there is an issue with JSON syntax in the parsing process. It provides three different constructors:

1. `JsonSyntaxException(String paramString)`: Creates an exception with a specific message.
2. `JsonSyntaxException(String paramString, Throwable paramThrowable)`: Creates an exception with a specific message and a cause.
3. `JsonSyntaxException(Throwable paramThrowable)`: Creates an exception with a cause. 

The `serialVersionUID` is a version control in a Serializable class. If you do not explicitly declare a serialVersionUID, then the Java Virtual Machine (JVM) will do so for you at runtime, based on various aspects of the class.
