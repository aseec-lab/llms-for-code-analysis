The `JsonReaderInternalAccess` is an abstract class in the Gson library, intended for internal use in the package `com.google.gson.internal`.

This class serves as an access point to the `JsonReader` object's internals. This class has a single method `promoteNameToValue`, an abstract method that gets implemented somewhere else in the Gson library. The method expects a `JsonReader` parameter and it throws an `IOException`.

The `INSTANCE` object seems to be a Singleton instance of a class that implements this abstract class.

The purpose of `promoteNameToValue` method is likely to manipulate JSON name-value pairs in some way, although the specific details are not provided in this code snippet.
