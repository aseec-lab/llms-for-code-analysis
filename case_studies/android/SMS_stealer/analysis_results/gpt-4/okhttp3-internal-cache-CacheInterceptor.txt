The `CacheInterceptor` class in OkHttp helps in the management of caching responses. The class implements the `Interceptor` interface which allows it to intercept incoming HTTP requests and decide whether the response can be retrieved from the cache or needs to be fetched over the network.

When an HTTP request is intercepted, this class utilizes the `InternalCache` object `cache` (which is passed as an argument while initializing the `CacheInterceptor` object) to get the response from the cache and use it if it's feasible. This decision is made using the `CacheStrategy` which analyzes the request and the cached response. 

The `CacheStrategy` object in this case also helps decide if the old response should be replaced with a new network response, which happens for a return code of 304 that indicates the response has not been modified. It then replaces and/or combines its headers with the new response accordingly.

In the case where a network request is needed, it closes the body of the old response to save memory. It is also in charge of storing the responses in the cache after they are fetched from the network.

The other helper methods in the class help in managing headers, dealing with specific HTTP headers, and checking and stripping out the body of responses.
