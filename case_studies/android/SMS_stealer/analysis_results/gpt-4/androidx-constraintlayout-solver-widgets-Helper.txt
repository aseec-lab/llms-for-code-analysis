The `Helper` interface defines methods for a helper class in the ConstraintLayout library.

- `add(ConstraintWidget paramConstraintWidget)` is used to add a ConstraintWidget into the Helper.

- `removeAllIds()` method is used to remove all the IDs of the involved widgets from the Helper class.

- `updateConstraints(ConstraintWidgetContainer paramConstraintWidgetContainer)` method is likely used to update the constraints of a ConstraintWidgetContainer from the Helper.

The commented part at the end seems to be some meta information about the location of this file, the Java compiler version used and the JD-Core version.
