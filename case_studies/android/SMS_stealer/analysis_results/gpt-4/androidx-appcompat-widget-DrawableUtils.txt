The `DrawableUtils` class provides utility methods for handling `Drawable` objects in Android applications. 

- `CHECKED_STATE_SET`: A state set for checked drawables.
- `EMPTY_STATE_SET`: An empty state set.
- `INSETS_NONE`: A constant `Rect` indicating no insets.
- `canSafelyMutateDrawable(Drawable paramDrawable)`: Checks if a drawable can be safely mutated depending on the Android version and the type of drawable.
- `fixDrawable(Drawable paramDrawable)`: Provides a workaround for a tinting issue with VectorDrawables on Android 5.0 (API level 21).
- `fixVectorDrawableTinting(Drawable paramDrawable)`: Changes the state of a drawable and resets it to the original state.
- `getOpticalBounds(Drawable paramDrawable)`: Retrieves the optical bounds of a drawable. If not available, it will attempt to call the `getOpticalInsets` method or otherwise return `INSETS_NONE`.
- `parseTintMode(int paramInt, PorterDuff.Mode paramMode)`: Translates an integer value to a corresponding `PorterDuff.Mode` for tinting.

This class ensures that the use of `Drawable` objects is compatible with different Android versions. The methods provided also deal with specific issues related to them, like safe mutation, optical bounds, and tinting problems.
