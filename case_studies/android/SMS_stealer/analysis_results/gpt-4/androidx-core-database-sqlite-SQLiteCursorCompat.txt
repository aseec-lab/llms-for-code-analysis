The `SQLiteCursorCompat` class provides a compatibility layer for the `SQLiteCursor` class, which is part of Android's SQLite database management class set. 

It has a static method `setFillWindowForwardOnly(SQLiteCursor paramSQLiteCursor, boolean paramBoolean)`. This method sets whether the `SQLiteCursor` should only fill its window with forward results of the query. 

The functionality is available only from Android API level 28 and above. When the SDK version is below 28, this method does nothing to maintain compatibility across different Android versions.
