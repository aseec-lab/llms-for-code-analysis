The `VersionedParcelStream` is a subclass of `VersionedParcel` in the `androidx.versionedparcelable` package and it is designed to read and write data to and from DataInputStream and DataOutputStream. This class also contains a number of constants defining the data types it can handle - these are integers and arrays of integers, longs, floats, doubles, booleans, strings, as well as Bundles and null values.

The `VersionedParcelStream` class has input and output stream fields, a field buffer and some other properties. It also includes a number of methods for reading and writing different types of data from/to the stream. The `readObject` and `writeObject` methods are used to read and write these various types of data in the stream.

The `readBoolean`, `readBundle`, `readByteArray`, `readCharSequence` and `readDouble` methods are developed to read corresponding types from the input stream. If there is an IOException during read operations, a `VersionedParcel.ParcelException` is thrown.

In addition to these, `VersionedParcelStream` overrides `closeField` and `createSubParcel` methods from its superclass. The `isStream` method is used to check if the current parcel is a stream.This part of code includes the implementation details for various read and write methods of VersionedParcelStream class. For each primitive data type like boolean, float, int, long, methods `read<Type>` and `write<Type>` are defined for reading and writing from and to, the stream respectively. Moreover, the `readField` method is used for reading data from input stream by taking a field id as parameter. This part also includes method definitions for handling complex types such as `Parcelables` and `Bundles`. 

In addition, class `FieldBuffer` is a private inner class that is used for buffering fields, which includes the `flushField` method to flush data stream, and manage output size. Some exceptions are also handled in case there are problems reading/writing from/to the stream. If parcelables need to be ignored, flags are set accordingly with the `setSerializationFlags` method.
