`TintTypedArray` is a utility class in the AndroidX `appcompat` library that provides methods for retrieving style attributes from a `TypedArray`, in a way that's compatible with older versions of Android. The class also provides several utility methods for obtaining style attributes like `Boolean`, `Color`, `Dimension`, `Drawable`, `Float`, `Font`, `Fraction`, `Int`, `String`, `CharSequence`, `TextArray`, and more, from a `TypedArray` and allowing to recycle the array after use. This class is often used for themeable or tintable widgets that need to handle backward compatibility. Three static methods are provided to obtain a `TintTypedArray` instance, where attributes are extracted from the context. It also includes a method to retrieve the original `TypedArray`.
