The `JsonAdapter` annotation is used to attach a custom serializer/deserializer to a class or a field in Gson library.

- `@Retention(RetentionPolicy.RUNTIME)` tells the JVM to keep this annotation accessible at runtime, so Gson can make use of it when serializing or deserializing objects.

- `@Target({ElementType.TYPE, ElementType.FIELD})` denotes that this annotation can be used on classes (TYPE) and fields (FIELD) level.

- `value()` method is used to specify the class of the Json adapter (serializer/deserializer).

- `nullSafe()` method is used to specify if the adapter would be used to serialize/deserialize null values. Default value is true, meaning it can handle nulls. If set to false, the adapter will not be invoked for null values.

This annotation aids in controlling the way objects are converted to/from JSON by providing a custom adapter.
