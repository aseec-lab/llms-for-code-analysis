The `@RestrictTo` is an annotation from the AndroidX library that helps to limit the visibility of a program element (e.g., methods, classes, constructors, fields, packages, or other annotations). This is not enforced by the Java compiler, but is intended to be enforced by lint tools, IDEs, etc.

It's used in conjunction with a `Scope` which indicates what the element should be restricted to. The possible Scopes are:

- `SUBCLASSES`: Restricts usage to subclasses of the class that this annotation is applied on.

- `LIBRARY`: Restricts usage to within the same "library" (e.g., a Gradle library module).

- `LIBRARY_GROUP`: Restricts usage to other libraries in the same group.

- `LIBRARY_GROUP_PREFIX`: Restricts usage to other libraries in the same group defined by the prefix in the group ID. 

- `GROUP_ID`: For use with artifacts that are published with a "groupId" (i.e., Maven group) 

- `TESTS`: Restricts usage to tests

The `@Retention(RetentionPolicy.CLASS)` annotation ensures the `@RestrictTo` annotation is stored in the class file during compilation but not needed at runtime. 

The `@Target` annotation indicates that this annotation can be used on types, methods, constructors, fields, packages, and other annotations.

The `value()` method is used to get the scope/s to which the restriction applies.
