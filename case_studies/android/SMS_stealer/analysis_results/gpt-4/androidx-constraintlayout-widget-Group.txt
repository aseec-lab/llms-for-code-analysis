This code defines a `Group` class which extends the `ConstraintHelper` class from the AndroidX ConstraintLayout library.

- It provides three constructors, each with different parameters: context alone, context, and attribute set, and context with attribute set and an integer parameter.
  
- The `init(AttributeSet)` method initializes the group with the provided attribute set. It also sets the `mUseViewMeasure` member to `false`.

- `onAttachedToWindow()`: This method is called whenever the view is attached to a window. It calls the parent version of this method and also applies layout features to the Group.

- `setElevation(float)`: This method sets the elevation of the group and then applies layout features.

- `setVisibility(int)`: This method sets the visibility of the group and then applies layout features.

- `updatePostLayout(ConstraintLayout)`: This method updates the layout parameters of the widget in the ConstraintLayout after layout has taken place. Specifically, it sets its width and height to 0.
  
The Group class is named so because it can be used to group and manipulate multiple widgets in a ConstraintLayout at once.
