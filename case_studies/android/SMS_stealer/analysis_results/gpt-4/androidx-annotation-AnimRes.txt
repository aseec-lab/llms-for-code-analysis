The `@AnimRes` annotation is used to annotate variables, parameters, methods, or local variables in Android that are referring to Android animation resource IDs. The purpose is to enhance code readability and catch potential misuses at compile time. 

The `@Retention(RetentionPolicy.CLASS)` annotation signifies that this annotation will be retained by the compiler at the class file level, but not necessarily by the Java Virtual Machine (JVM) at runtime.

The `@Documented` annotation indicates that this annotation should be documented by javadoc or similar tools by default.

The trailing metadata doesn't add to the functionality of the `@AnimRes` annotation, and relates to the Java Decompiler (JD-Core).
