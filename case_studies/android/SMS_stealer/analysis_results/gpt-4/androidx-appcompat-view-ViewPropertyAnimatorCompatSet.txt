The `ViewPropertyAnimatorCompatSet` class is designed to help manage and manipulate a set of `ViewPropertyAnimatorCompat` objects. It maintains an internal list of these animator objects to which you can add instances and manipulate them collectively.

- `play(ViewPropertyAnimatorCompat animator)` adds an animator to the list provided it's not yet started.
- `playSequentially()` allows you to play two animations sequentially.
- `cancel()` cancels all animations in the list.
- `setDuration(long duration)`, `setInterpolator(Interpolator interpolator)`, and `setListener(ViewPropertyAnimatorListener listener)` set the shared properties for all animators in the set.
- `start()` starts all animations.

This class also keeps track of the animation lifecycle (started or not, animation ends, etc) with the use of `ViewPropertyAnimatorListenerAdapter` and `ViewPropertyAnimatorListener`.

Please note the code file may not be complete. It seems part of a larger Android project with dependencies on other parts of the codebase that aren't included in the provided segment.
