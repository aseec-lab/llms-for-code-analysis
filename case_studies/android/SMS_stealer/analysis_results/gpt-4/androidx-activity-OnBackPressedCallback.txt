The `OnBackPressedCallback` class is an abstract class that deals with the back press events in an Android activity. It contains a `CopyOnWriteArrayList` of `Cancellable` objects, and a boolean attribute `mEnabled`. 

The constructor of this class sets the value of `mEnabled`. 

The `addCancellable()` method is used to add a `Cancellable` object to `mCancellables`. 

The `handleOnBackPressed()` method is declared as abstract, meaning it must be implemented by any class extending `OnBackPressedCallback`. 

The method `isEnabled()` returns the value of `mEnabled`.

The `remove()` method cancels all `Cancellable` objects in `mCancellables`. 

The `removeCancellable()` method removes a specific `Cancellable` from `mCancellables`. 

The `setEnabled()` method is used to modify the value of `mEnabled`.
