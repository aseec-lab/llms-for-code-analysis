This file contains a class named `ViewConfigurationCompat` that helps in maintaining compatibility with different versions of Android when using `ViewConfiguration`. It contains static methods for getting scaled scrolling factors, hover slop, paging touch slop, vertical scrolling factors, and more.

Key features:

1. `getScaledHorizontalScrollFactor()`: Returns the horizontal scroll factor based on the Android version. For version 26 and above, it uses the built-in function in `ViewConfiguration`. For previous versions, it uses the custom method `getLegacyScrollFactor()`.

2. `getScaledHoverSlop()`: Returns the hover slop based on the Android version. For version 28 and above, it uses the built-in function in `ViewConfiguration`. For previous versions, it uses half of the touch slop.

3. `getScaledPagingTouchSlop()`: Returns the scaled paging touch slop.

4. `getScaledVerticalScrollFactor()`: Returns the vertical scroll factor based on the Android version.

5. `hasPermanentMenuKey()`: Returns whether the device has a permanent menu key.

6. `shouldShowMenuShortcutsWhenKeyboardPresent()`: Returns whether menu shortcuts should be shown when the keyboard is present based on the Android version.

The class also includes private static methods for getting the legacy scroll factor based on the Android version (`getLegacyScrollFactor()`). It uses reflection to try and access a `getScaledScrollFactor()` function on `ViewConfiguration` if it is available.
