The `StringRequestListener` interface is part of the `com.androidnetworking.interfaces` package. It defines the contracts for handling the responses of string requests in an asynchronous way.

This interface declares two methods:

1. `void onError(ANError paramANError);`: This method is invoked when the string request fails due to some reason. The actual error is passed as an object of type `ANError`.

2. `void onResponse(String paramString);`: This method is invoked when the string request completes successfully. The server response data as a `String` is passed to this method.

Classes that implement this interface will need to provide concrete implementations of these methods to handle success and failure scenarios while dealing with string requests.
