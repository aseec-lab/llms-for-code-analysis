The `JSONObjectRequestListener` interface is part of the `com.androidnetworking.interfaces` package. It's designed to provide a specified behavior for handling network requests and responses where the response is expected to be a `JSONObject`. The interface provides two methods:

1. `void onError(ANError paramANError);`: This method is invoked whenever an error occurs during the network request. The `paramANError` parameter contains details about the occurred error.

2. `void onResponse(JSONObject paramJSONObject);`: This method is invoked when a response is received for the network request. The `paramJSONObject` parameter is the JSON Object obtained from the response body.

Anyone implementing this interface needs to define what should happen when a response is received or an error occurs.
