This code block contains an interface `NestedScrollingChild3` which is an extension of another interface `NestedScrollingChild2` in the package `androidx.core.view`. 

An interface is a reference type in Java, similar to a class, that can contain only constants, method signatures, default methods, static methods, and nested types. 

In this case, the `NestedScrollingChild3` interface has one method declaration: 
`void dispatchNestedScroll(int paramInt1, int paramInt2, int paramInt3, int paramInt4, int[] paramArrayOfint1, int paramInt5, int[] paramArrayOfint2);`

This method is expected to be implemented by any class that implements this interface. 

The method appears to handle the dispatching of a nested scrolling action with various parameters including four integers and two integer arrays. This is part of the Android system's nested scrolling system, likely to be used when you have a scrolling container within a scrolling container, and you want the parent and child scrolls to be coordinated.
