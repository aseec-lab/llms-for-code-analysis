The `MotionInterpolator` is an abstract class that implements the `android.view.animation.Interpolator` interface from Android. The `Interpolator` API helps in achieving various rate of change curves, essential for smooth animation effects.

It has two abstract methods:

1. `getInterpolation(float paramFloat)` method: Takes in a float input and provides the interpolated output. In the context of animations, the interpolation determines how the animation transitions between different states, such as position, size, rotation, and so on.

2. `getVelocity()` method: This could possibly return the current velocity of an animation at a particular instant. In a continuous animation, the velocity measures how quickly the property being animated changes per second.

These methods should be overridden in the class extending `MotionInterpolator`.
