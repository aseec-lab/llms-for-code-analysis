The `OperationCanceledException` class in the package `androidx.core.os` is a custom exception class that extends `RuntimeException`. This exception is typically used to denote that an operation has been cancelled.

There are two constructors for this class. 

The first constructor `OperationCanceledException()` does not take any arguments and calls the second constructor with `null` argument.

The second constructor `OperationCanceledException(String paramString)` accepts a string message as an input which is passed to the parent `RuntimeException` class. When this `OperationCanceledException` is thrown, the provided message would be shown.

In simple terms, this exception can be used in the code to indicate that an operation was cancelled, and optionally, a specific cancel message can be included.
