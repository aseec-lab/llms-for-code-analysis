The `FieldNamingPolicy` class in the `com.google.gson` package is an enumeration that defines several policies on how to translate Java field names into JSON field names. 

It provides different strategies for this purpose, including: 

- `IDENTITY`, which returns original field name, 
- `LOWER_CASE_WITH_UNDERSCORES`, 
- `LOWER_CASE_WITH_DASHES`, 
- `UPPER_CAMEL_CASE`, which will return the name with first letter in uppercase and remaining parts as is, and 
- `UPPER_CAMEL_CASE_WITH_SPACES`, where the name is split by spaces at camel case changes, and the first letter is capitalized. 

It also provides several utility methods that are used for modifying and manipulating strings according to the different naming policies. These methods include `modifyString()`, `separateCamelCase()` and `upperCaseFirstLetter()`.

The actual conversion of a field name according to a given naming policy is done by calling the `translateName(Field)` method, which is declared in each enum instance.
