The `PopupWindowCompat.java` file in the AndroidX library provides the `PopupWindowCompat` compatibility class with methods that handle different versions of Android. It provides mechanisms to control popup windows' properties, such as overlap anchor and window layout type.

Here's a brief explanation of the methods:

1. `boolean getOverlapAnchor(PopupWindow paramPopupWindow)`: Returns true if the popup window's anchor overlaps the anchor view.

2. `int getWindowLayoutType(PopupWindow paramPopupWindow)`: Returns the layout type of the window.

3. `void setOverlapAnchor(PopupWindow paramPopupWindow, boolean paramBoolean)`: Sets whether the popup window's anchor should overlap its anchor view.

4. `void setWindowLayoutType(PopupWindow paramPopupWindow, int paramInt)`: Sets the layout type of the window.

5. `void showAsDropDown(PopupWindow paramPopupWindow, View paramView, int paramInt1, int paramInt2, int paramInt3)`: Displays the popup window as a drop-down below the anchor view or to the side of it depending on the gravity and anchor.

For APIs below version 23, this class uses reflection to access some fields or call methods directly if they are not accessible due to changes in API levels.
