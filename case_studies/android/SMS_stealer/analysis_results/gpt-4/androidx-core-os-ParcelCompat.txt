The `ParcelCompat` final class is a utility for handling the `Parcel` object in Android. It provides two static methods:

- `readBoolean(Parcel paramParcel)`: This method reads an integer from the provided `Parcel` object and returns `true` if the integer is not zero, `false` otherwise.

- `writeBoolean(Parcel paramParcel, boolean paramBoolean)`: This method writes the provided boolean value to the `Parcel` object as an integer (either 1 for `true` or 0 for `false`).

These methods aim to simplify interaction with `Parcel` objects by providing a way to directly read and write boolean values, which is not natively supported by the `Parcel` class.
