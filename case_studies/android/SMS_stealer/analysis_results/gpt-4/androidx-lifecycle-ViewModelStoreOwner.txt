`ViewModelStoreOwner` is an interface defined in the `androidx.lifecycle` package. This interface contains a single method, `getViewModelStore()`, which is expected to return a `ViewModelStore` object.

A `ViewModelStore` is an objecct that's designed to hold and manage `ViewModel` instances in a lifecycle-conscious way, which means it preserves `ViewModels` over configuration changes such as screen rotations.

The interface `ViewModelStoreOwner` is usually implemented by classes that can own a `ViewModelStore`, like a `Fragment` or `Activity`. These classes, by implementing the interface, promise to have a way to provide a `ViewModelStore`.
