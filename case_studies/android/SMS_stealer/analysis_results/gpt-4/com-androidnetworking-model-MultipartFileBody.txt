The `MultipartFileBody` class is a simple Java object that represents a part of a Multipart body. It has two fields:

- `contentType`: The type of content that the body part contains.
- `file`: A `File` object representing the actual content of the body part.

The class has a constructor that accepts a `File` object and a `String`. These parameters are used to initialize `file` and `contentType` respectively.

An instance of `MultipartFileBody` can be used to represent a file part in a Multipart HTTP request body.
