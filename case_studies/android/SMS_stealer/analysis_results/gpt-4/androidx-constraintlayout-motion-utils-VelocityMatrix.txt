The `VelocityMatrix` class is used to handle transformations related to motion in the constraint layout, covering rotation, translation, and scaling. 

- It stores the rate of change of rotation (`mDRotate`), translation in X and Y directions (`mDTranslateX`, `mDTranslateY`), and the scale in X and Y directions (`mDScaleX`, `mDScaleY`), and the angle of rotation (`mRotate`).
- `applyTransform` method applies these transformations (translation, rotation, and scaling) to an array of float values.
- The `clear` function resets all transformation velocities back to zero. 
- The `setRotationVelocity`, `setScaleVelocity` and `setTranslationVelocity` methods accept either a `KeyCycleOscillator` or `SplineSet` object and a float value, updating the respective transformation velocities and if `SplineSet` object is given, it also updates rotation as well.
- `SplineSet` and `KeyCycleOscillator` classes are used for animation interpolations and cycles in the constraint layout's motion component.
