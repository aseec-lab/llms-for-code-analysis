The `JsonToken.java` file in Gson library defines a public enum `JsonToken`. This enumeration represents the type of JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) tokens that can be encountered during parsing of a JSON document.

The listed enumeration values are: `BEGIN_ARRAY`, `BEGIN_OBJECT`, `BOOLEAN`, `END_ARRAY`, `END_DOCUMENT`, `END_OBJECT`, `NAME`, `NULL`, `NUMBER`, `STRING`. Each of these enum values represents a type of JSON token.

In the static block of this enum, instances of `JsonToken` are created for each enumeration value. After creating these instances, they are added to the `$VALUES` array. This array holds all of the enumeration values for `JsonToken`.

Being an enum, this class is part of Gson's internal mechanism for recognizing and handling different types of data in a JSON document. It allows Gson to correctly parse and serialize JSON with varied types of elements (like arrays, objects, booleans, nulls, numbers, and strings).
