The `FullLifecycleObserver` is an interface that extends `LifecycleObserver`. This interface is part of the Android Lifecycle library and is used to observe all lifecycle states in a way that is decoupled from any lifecycle-aware component, such as fragments and activities.

It declares methods for handling different lifecycle states, `onCreate()`, `onDestroy()`, `onPause()`, `onResume()`, `onStart()`, and `onStop()`. It is expected that any class implementing `FullLifecycleObserver` will provide an actual implementation for these methods.

Each method in the `FullLifecycleObserver` interface reflects corresponding lifecycles states. They receive a `LifecycleOwner` object as a parameter. A `LifecycleOwner` represents a component, like an Activity or a Fragment, which has an Android lifecycle.
