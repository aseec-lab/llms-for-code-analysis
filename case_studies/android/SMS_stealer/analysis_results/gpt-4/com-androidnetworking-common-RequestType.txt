The `RequestType` interface in the Android Networking library is a simple definition of constant integers that represent different types of network requests. These are:
- `DOWNLOAD` is represented by the constant 1 and signifies a request type intended for downloading data.
- `MULTIPART` is represented by the constant 2 and is typically used for requests that need to send or receive multipart data.
- `SIMPLE` is represented by the constant 0 and is used for basic network requests. 

This interface is useful when you want to differentiate between different types of requests in your networking library based on their functionality.
