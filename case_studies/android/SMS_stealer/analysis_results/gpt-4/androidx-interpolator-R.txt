The code defines an empty final class named `R` within the package `androidx.interpolator`. This is usually an auto-generated class in Android that contains IDs for all the resources of your application, although in this case it seems to be empty and doesn't contain any resources ID. The class is final, so it can't be subclassed. The code is decompiled from a JAR file as indicated by the file location comment at the bottom.
