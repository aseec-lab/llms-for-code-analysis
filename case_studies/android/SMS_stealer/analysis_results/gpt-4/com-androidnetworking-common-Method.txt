The `Method` interface in the Android Networking library defines integer constants that correspond to different HTTP methods. The HTTP methods represented by these constants are `DELETE`, `GET`, `HEAD`, `OPTIONS`, `PATCH`, `POST`, and `PUT`. These constants can be used to specify the HTTP method to be used when setting up a network request. For example, `Method.GET` would be used for a GET request, `Method.POST` for a POST request, and so on. This approach provides a clear and readable way to set the HTTP method for a request.
