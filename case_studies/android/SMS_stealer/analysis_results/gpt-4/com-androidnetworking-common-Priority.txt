The `Priority` class is an enumeration (enum) inside the package `com.androidnetworking.common`. 

This enum is used to define the priority levels of network operations. It has four constants; `HIGH`, `IMMEDIATE`, `LOW`, and `MEDIUM`. 

These priority levels can be used to control the order of execution of network requests. For example, a network request with `HIGH` priority will be executed before a request with `LOW` priority. 

The `IMMEDIATE` priority is likely to be executed right away, regardless of any other requests. 

The `$VALUES` array is a static final array that stores the constants of this enum in the order they were declared. 

The JD-Core Version and Java compiler version indicate that this class was possibly decompiled from a jar file.
