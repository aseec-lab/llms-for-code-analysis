The `DisplayCompat` class provides methods for fetching display details and manipulating display modes for different Android versions. 

This class has several private methods to obtain display properties like `getPhysicalDisplaySize`, `getSystemProperty`, `isSonyBravia4kTv`, `isTv`, `physicalSizeEquals`, and `getSupportedModes`.

`getPhysicalDisplaySize` retrieves physical display size by checking Android's build version and does special handling for Sony Bravia 4k TVs. It then gets the mode of the display if it's available. 

`getSupportedModes` returns a list of support display modes for the device.

`getSystemProperty` provides system properties, `isSonyBravia4kTv` checks whether the device is a Sony Bravia 4K TV, `isTv` verifies if the device is a TV and `physicalSizeEquals` checks if the current mode matches with a given point.

It also declares an inner class `ModeCompat` that holds compatible mode details for a display device. This includes both physical display size and native display mode for a device's display.
