The `LocationManagerCompat` class provides compatibility support for location-based services. 

It contains one main static method:

- `isLocationEnabled(LocationManager paramLocationManager)`: This checks if the location service is enabled on the device. It works differently based on the Android SDK version. If the SDK is version 28 or higher (`API_LEVEL_P`), it uses the `isLocationEnabled()` method from `LocationManager` directly. If it's lower than 28, it checks if either `network` or `gps` location providers are enabled.
