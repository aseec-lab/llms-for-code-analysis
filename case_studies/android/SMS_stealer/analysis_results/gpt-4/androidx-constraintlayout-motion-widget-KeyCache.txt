The `KeyCache` class in the `androidx.constraintlayout.motion.widget` package is used to cache float values associated with a specific object and a key string.

The class contains a HashMap `map` that holds object keys associated with another HashMap. This inner HashMap holds String keys associated with float arrays.

`getFloatValue(Object paramObject, String paramString, int paramInt)` is a function that retrieves a float value from the cache using an object, a string key, and an integer index. If the value doesn't exist, it returns `Float.NaN`.

`setFloatValue(Object paramObject, String paramString, int paramInt, float paramFloat)` is a function that sets a float value in the cache at a specified index in the array identified by the given object and key string. If the array doesn't have enough elements, it creates a new copy of the array with a larger size to accommodate the index location.
