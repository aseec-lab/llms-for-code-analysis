The `NonParcelField` is an annotation used in Android development. It can be applied to fields which should not be included during the parceling process performed by `Parcelable` classes. 

The `@Retention(RetentionPolicy.SOURCE)` annotation indicates that this annotation is not included in the .class file and is discarded by the compiler. 

The `@Target({ElementType.FIELD})` annotation indicates that this annotation can only be used on fields.

Overall, it is used to exclude certain fields from the parceling/unparceling process when sending data across threads or processes in Android.
