The `SupportSubMenu` interface is a part of AndroidX library, which extends both the `SupportMenu` and `SubMenu` interfaces.

However, there are no methods declared within this interface. It is simply extending these interfaces which suggests it is treated as a bridge to represent a `SubMenu` object with additional capabilities provided by `SupportMenu` in the AndroidX context.

A `SubMenu` is a type of `Menu` that can show a secondary list of options to the user, typically used for displaying sub-categories within a larger menu in an application's user interface.

The `SupportMenu` is an enhanced `Menu` interface provided by AndroidX, it includes several extra methods over the traditional `Menu` interface for additional functionality or more granular control over menu behavior in Android apps.
