The `UnrepeatableRequestBody` is an interface defined in the `okhttp3.internal.http` package. The purpose of this interface might be to provide a marker for request bodies that cannot be repeated. However, the interface doesn't declare any methods or fields. The absence of any methods indicates that this is a Marker interface. The presence of a type as an `UnrepeatableRequestBody` imposes no additional requirements or functionality; it simply allows the framework to treat these types of bodies differently when transmitting over the network. The details of how this interface is used would depend on other parts of the OkHttp framework code.
