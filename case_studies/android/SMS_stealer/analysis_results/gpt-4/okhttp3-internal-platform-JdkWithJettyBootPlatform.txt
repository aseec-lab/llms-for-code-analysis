This file defines a class `JdkWithJettyBootPlatform`, which is a specific implementation of the `Platform` class in OkHttp, customized for platforms that utilize Jetty's ALPN (Application-Layer Protocol Negotiation) implementation. 

Its important methods include `afterHandshake(SSLSocket paramSSLSocket)` that removes the socket after handshake, `configureTlsExtensions(SSLSocket paramSSLSocket, String paramString, List<Protocol> paramList)` which configures TLS extensions for the socket, and `getSelectedProtocol(SSLSocket paramSSLSocket)` which gets the selected protocol for the socket.

The `JettyNegoProvider` private class, acts as an invocation handler which provides the protocols, selects the best protocol according to the server's preference, and stores the selected protocol.

Overall, the code enables better interoperation between HTTP/2 protocol and Jetty's SSL/TLS negotiation. Java compiler version used here is 6. 

The class also includes a `buildIfSupported` method which tries to build a `JdkWithJettyBootPlatform` instance if the necessary Jetty classes/methods are present, returning `null` otherwise, providing a way to check compatibility with the Jetty library at runtime.
