The `Util` class provides a set of utility methods used for various tasks in the application:

- `UTF_8` is a `Charset` instance representing UTF-8.
- `arrayRangeEquals()` checks if a range of bytes in two arrays are identical.
- `checkOffsetAndCount()` checks if the specified offset and count are within the bounds of a specified size. If not, it throws an `ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException` with a detailed message.
- `reverseBytesInt()`, `reverseBytesLong()`, and `reverseBytesShort()` are methods that reverse the byte order of an integer, long, and short, respectively. This is often used for changing between little-endian and big-endian data formats.
- `sneakyRethrow()` and `sneakyThrow2()` are used to rethrow an exception. This is often used in scenarios where you need to propagate checked exceptions without declaring them in the method signature. The `sneakyThrow2()` method uses a generic type to trick the Java compiler into allowing a checked exception to be thrown without being declared.
