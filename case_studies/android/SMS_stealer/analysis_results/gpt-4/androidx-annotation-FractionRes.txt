The `FractionRes` annotation in Android is used to denote that a method, parameter, field or local variable is supposed to represent a fraction resource reference in the app's resources, typically referring to a fraction defined in an XML file. 

Like `BoolRes`, the `@Retention(RetentionPolicy.CLASS)` annotation specifies that this annotation will be held in the compiled .class file but ignored at runtime. The `@Target` annotation once again states that this annotation can be used with method declarations, parameters, fields, and local variables. The `@Documented` annotation indicates that `FractionRes` should be documented by Javadoc. 

The comment at the bottom of the file provides locations and versions for the Java compiler and JD-Core Decompiler used.
