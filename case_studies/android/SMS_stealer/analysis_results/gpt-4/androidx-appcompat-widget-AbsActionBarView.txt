This is the abstract class `AbsActionBarView` which extends `ViewGroup` from the Android package `androidx.appcompat.widget`. It's used as a base class for views that will host action items and action-mode views in the ActionBar.

The class has protected variables like `mActionMenuPresenter` (which controls the presentation of items in the action menu), `mMenuView` (which hosts the action items and action-mode views), `mContentHeight` for storing the height, `mVisibilityAnim` (to animate the visibility), and `mPopupContext` (context for creating popup menus).

The class includes methods for handling visibility animation, measuring and positioning child views, handling configuration changes, touch and hover events. It also provides methods to manipulate elements of the ActionBar like the overflow menu.

Another noteworthy inner class here is `VisibilityAnimListener`, which is used to facilitate visibility animations. It implements `ViewPropertyAnimatorListener` and overrides `onAnimationEnd`, `onAnimationStart`, and `onAnimationCancel` operations.

Please note that this code is part of the AndroidX library, which is an open-source project that provides added functionality and compatibility benefits to Android development.
