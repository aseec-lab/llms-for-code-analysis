The `@ContentView` is an annotation in AndroidX that is commonly used above constructors. It provides a way to define the layout to be used for an activity or a fragment without having to explicitly call `setContentView()` in the onCreate method of every activity. 

Like the earlier mentioned annotations, `@Retention(RetentionPolicy.CLASS)` signifies that the annotation will be recorded in the class file by the compiler but need not be retained by the VM at runtime. The `@Target` annotation is used to indicate where the `@ContentView` annotation can be used, in this case, constructors. 

The trailing metadata does not affect the functionality of the `@ContentView` annotation; it is for Java Decompiler (JD-Core).
