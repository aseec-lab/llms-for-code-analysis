The `SubMenuWrapperICS` class is a subclass of `MenuWrapperICS` and implements the `SubMenu` interface. This class acts as a wrapper around `SupportSubMenu`, allowing the underlying submenu to be used where a standard Android `SubMenu` would typically be used, while still providing the additional features of the `SupportSubMenu`.

There is a series of methods provided in this class for modifying the properties of the underlying submenu including:

- `clearHeader()` to clear the header of the submenu.
- `getItem()` to get a menu item from the submenu.
- `setHeaderIcon()` to set the header icon of the submenu using either a `Drawable` or a resource ID.
- `setHeaderTitle()` to set the header title of the submenu using either a `CharSequence` or a resource ID.
- `setHeaderView()` to set the view of submenu's header.
- `setIcon()` to set the icon of the submenu using either a `Drawable` or a resource ID.

These methods typically perform the requested change on the `SupportSubMenu` and then return a reference to the `SubMenuWrapperICS` itself to allow for method chaining.
