The `AppCompatRadioButton` class is an extension of the `RadioButton` Android widget and provides backward compatibility and additional features. The additional features are mainly regarding how the `RadioButton` can be customized visually.

The class includes features to help with custom attributes such as button tinting via the `AppCompatCompoundButtonHelper`, background tinting via the `AppCompatBackgroundHelper`, and advanced text-related features via `AppCompatTextHelper`. 

The `setSupportButtonTintList` and `setSupportButtonTintMode` methods are used to set the button's tint and the blending mode used to apply the tint. 

There are also methods to get the tint and mode to apply to the drawable and the background of this view, fetched using the `getSupportButtonTintList`, `getSupportButtonTintMode`, `getSupportBackgroundTintList` and `getSupportBackgroundTintMode` methods.

The `setBackgroundDrawable` and `setBackgroundResource` methods are overridden to allow the `AppCompatBackgroundHelper` to perform necessary functions when these methods are called. 

This helps to ensure consistent behavior across different API levels of Android.
