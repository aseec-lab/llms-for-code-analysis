The `OkHttpResponseAndJSONObjectRequestListener` interface represents a listener for network requests that are expected to return a response encoded as a `JSONObject`, using OkHttp as the underlying HTTP client.

This interface is part of the `com.androidnetworking.interfaces` package and declares two methods:

1. `onError(ANError paramANError)`: This method is called when an error occurs during the network request operation. It takes an object of `ANError` type which contains details about the occurred error.

2. `onResponse(Response paramResponse, JSONObject paramJSONObject)`: This method is called when a network request is successfully completed. The method receives two parameters: a `Response` object representing the OkHttp response and a `JSONObject` that contains the actual server response in JSON format.

Any class that implements the `OkHttpResponseAndJSONObjectRequestListener` interface will need to provide concrete implementations for these two methods, defining behavior for handling success and error scenarios.
