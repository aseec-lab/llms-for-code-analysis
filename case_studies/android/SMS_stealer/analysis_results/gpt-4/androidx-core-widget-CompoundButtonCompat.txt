The `CompoundButtonCompat` class in AndroidX provides compatibility methods for CompoundButton operations. 

1. `getButtonDrawable(CompoundButton paramCompoundButton)`: Returns the drawable used for the button graphic.

2. `getButtonTintList(CompoundButton paramCompoundButton)`: Returns the tint list applied to the button drawable.

3. `getButtonTintMode(CompoundButton paramCompoundButton)`: Returns the blending mode used to apply the tint to the button drawable.

4. `setButtonTintList(CompoundButton paramCompoundButton, ColorStateList paramColorStateList)`: Applies a tint to the button drawable.

5. `setButtonTintMode(CompoundButton paramCompoundButton, PorterDuff.Mode paramMode)`: Specifies the blending mode which is to be used to apply the tint listed via `setButtonTintList` to the button drawable. 

The class uses reflection to fetch and set properties of the `CompoundButton`, and uses the interface `TintableCompoundButton` for backwards compatibility for older versions where these methods were not present in the API.
