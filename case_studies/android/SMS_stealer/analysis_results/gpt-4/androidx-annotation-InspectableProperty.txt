The `InspectableProperty` annotation is defined in this package. It's used to provide extra information about a class property, especially for tools that inspect properties, like the Android Studio's Layout Inspector.

The main properties of `InspectableProperty` annotation are:
- `attributeId`: The attribute ID of the property. Defaults to 0.
- `enumMapping`: Mapping for enum properties. Empty by default.
- `flagMapping`: Mapping for flag properties. Empty by default.
- `hasAttributeId`: Determines whether the property has an attribute ID or not. Defaults to true.
- `name`: The name of the property. Defaults to an empty string.
- `valueType`: Determines the type of the property value. It can be one of the values defined in `ValueType` enum. Defaults to `ValueType.INFERRED`.

`EnumEntry` and `FlagEntry` are additional annotations used within the `InspectableProperty`.

The `ValueType` enum represents types of property values that can be used within `InspectableProperty`. The types can be COLOR, GRAVITY, INFERRED, INT_ENUM, INT_FLAG, NONE, and RESOURCE_ID.

The part at the end seems to be metadata related to the file location and Java compiler version, and doesn't contribute to the functionality of the `InspectableProperty` annotation.
