The `TimeUtils.java` class provides utilities for formatting and handling time durations. 

It includes the following key methods:

1. `formatDuration(long paramLong1, long paramLong2, PrintWriter paramPrintWriter)`: Formats the time duration between `paramLong1` and `paramLong2` and writes the result to the given `PrintWriter`.

2. `formatDuration(long paramLong, PrintWriter paramPrintWriter)`: Formats the given duration and writes the result to the given `PrintWriter`.

3. `formatDuration(long paramLong, PrintWriter paramPrintWriter, int paramInt)`: Formats the given duration and writes the result to the given `PrintWriter` with a specified field width.

4. `formatDuration(long paramLong, StringBuilder paramStringBuilder)`: Formats the given duration and appends the result to the given `StringBuilder`.

5. `printField(char[] paramArrayOfchar, int paramInt1, char paramChar, int paramInt2, boolean paramBoolean, int paramInt3)`: Helper method used by the format methods to print a single time field.

6. `accumField(int paramInt1, int paramInt2, boolean paramBoolean, int paramInt3)`: Helper method used by the format methods to decide the length of each field.

Note that this class makes heavy use of synchronization to ensure thread safety as it internally uses a static character buffer.
