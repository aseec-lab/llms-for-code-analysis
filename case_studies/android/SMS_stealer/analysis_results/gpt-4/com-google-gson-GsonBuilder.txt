The `GsonBuilder` class is a part of the `com.google.gson` package and it is used to build `Gson` instances. `Gson` is a popular JSON parsing and creating library in Java.

- Many methods in the `GsonBuilder` class are designed to set configuration for the `Gson` object it creates. Examples include `setDateFormat()`, `setFieldNamingPolicy(FieldNamingPolicy)`, `setLenient()`, `setPrettyPrinting()`, etc.

- Also, `GsonBuilder` provides several methods to register type adapters (`registerTypeAdapter()`, `registerTypeAdapterFactory()`, `registerTypeHierarchyAdapter()`) which are used to instruct `Gson` how to serialize or deserialize certain types of objects.

- This class also has methods to add strategies for excluding certain fields during the serialization and deserialization process. These are `addSerializationExclusionStrategy()`, `addDeserializationExclusionStrategy()`,  and `setExclusionStrategies()`.

- The `create()` method of `GsonBuilder` is responsible to create a fully configured `Gson` object which is ready for use. It includes all the defined serialization/deserialization strategies, type adapters, naming policies, format settings and other configuration options which were set using `GsonBuilder` methods. 

- Last but not least, for thread-safety, this class is designed in such a way that it can be used to create multiple independent `Gson` instances without interfering with each other.
