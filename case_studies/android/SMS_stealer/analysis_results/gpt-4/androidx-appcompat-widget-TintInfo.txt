The `TintInfo` class is a simple data holder for tinting information related to a view. This class has four properties: 

- `mHasTintList`: A boolean flag indicating whether `mTintList` has a valid value.
- `mHasTintMode`: A boolean flag indicating whether `mTintMode` has a valid value.
- `mTintList`: A `ColorStateList` object defining color states for tinting.
- `mTintMode`: An object of `PorterDuff.Mode` that specifies the blending mode to be applied for tinting.

The class also provides the `clear()` method, which resets all properties to their default states i.e., `null` for `mTintList` and `mTintMode` and `false` for `mHasTintList` and `mHasTintMode`.

This class is typically used in situations where views require tinting, and this information needs to be stored and transferred.
