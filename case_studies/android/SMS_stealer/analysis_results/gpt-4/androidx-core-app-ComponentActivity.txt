The `ComponentActivity` class is a type of `Activity` that provides support for Lifecycle and other Android X features. It implements `LifecycleOwner` and `KeyEventDispatcher.Component`.

Data Members:
- `mExtraDataMap`: A map to hold extra data in key-value pairs.
- `mLifecycleRegistry`: Maintains and handles the lifecycle-related work.

Methods:
- `dispatchKeyEvent(KeyEvent paramKeyEvent)`: Dispatches a given `KeyEvent`.
- `dispatchKeyShortcutEvent(KeyEvent paramKeyEvent)`: Dispatches a given `KeyEvent` shortcut.
- `getExtraData(Class<T> paramClass)`: Fetches the extra data associated with the provided class.
- `getLifecycle()`: Returns the Lifecycle of the current Activity.
- `onCreate(Bundle paramBundle)`: Hook method called when the activity is created. It also injects the `ReportFragment`.
- `onSaveInstanceState(Bundle paramBundle)`: Hook method called to save the instance state.
- `putExtraData(ExtraData paramExtraData)`: Stores extra data into `mExtraDataMap` with its Class type as its associated key.
- `superDispatchKeyEvent(KeyEvent paramKeyEvent)`: Dispatches KeyEvent into the super implementation, bypassing the current activity's implementation.

The `ExtraData` class is a placeholder class used for storing extra data. It's marked as deprecated, indicating that developers should find a newer way to store extra data for an activity.
