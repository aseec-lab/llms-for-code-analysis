This file `FragmentTransitionCompat21.java` belongs to the `androidx.fragment.app` package. It provides a set of methods to control and manage transitions for fragments. This class extends `FragmentTransitionImpl` and uses the native Android Transition API (available from Android 21 onwards).

The tasks performed by the methods in this class include:

- Adding/removing a view to/from a Transition object (`addTarget(...)`, `removeTarget(...)`).
- Applying a Transition to a set of views (`addTargets(...)`) or replacing a Transition's target views (`replaceTargets(...)`).
- Triggering a transition on a ViewGroup (`beginDelayedTransition(...)`). 
- Cloning a Transition object (`cloneTransition(...)`).
- Merging transitions in sequences or simultaneously (`mergeTransitionsInSequence(...)`, `mergeTransitionsTogether(...)`).
- Handling visibility of fragment views during transitions (`scheduleHideFragmentView(...)`, `scheduleRemoveTargets(...)`).
- Settings the location for the start of the Transition (`setEpicenter(...)`).
- Dealing with shared element transitions, including setting and swapping target views (`setSharedElementTargets(...)`, `swapSharedElementTargets(...)`).
- Wrapping a Transition into a TransitionSet (`wrapTransitionInSet(...)`).
- Checking if a class instance can handle the Transition (`canHandle(...)`).
