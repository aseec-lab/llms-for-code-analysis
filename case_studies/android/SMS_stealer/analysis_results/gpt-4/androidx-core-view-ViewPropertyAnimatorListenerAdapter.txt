The `ViewPropertyAnimatorListenerAdapter` class in the `androidx.core.view` package is a simple "no-operation" (or "nop") implementation of the `ViewPropertyAnimatorListener` interface. 

The `ViewPropertyAnimatorListener` interface has methods to handle animation callback events: `onAnimationStart`, `onAnimationEnd` and `onAnimationCancel`. However, in this no-operation implementation (`ViewPropertyAnimatorListenerAdapter`), all these methods are empty. 

This class is useful when you want to listen for a subset of all the `ViewPropertyAnimatorListener` events. You can subclass it and only override the methods for the events you care about, instead of implementing the full interface and potentially have empty method implementations.
