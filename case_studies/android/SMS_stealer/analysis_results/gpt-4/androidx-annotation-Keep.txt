The `@Keep` annotation provided by AndroidX is a way of ensuring that the annotated class, method or field is not stripped away when the app is minified at compile time.

- `@Retention(RetentionPolicy.CLASS)`: This means that the annotation will be retained at compile time but not at runtime.

- `@Target`: This is used to mark the program elements (packages, types, annotation types, constructors, methods, fields) which can be annotated with `@Keep`.

The `@Keep` annotation is useful to prevent vital code from being removed during the build process when using tools that optimize the code by removing unused code sections. 

The comment at the end is metadata used by Java Decompiler (JD-Core) but does not affect how the `@Keep` annotation works.
