The `IntentCompat` class in the `androidx.core.content` package is a helper for dealing with `Intent` objects. It provides a constant for the "Leanback Launcher" category, which correlates with Android TV platforms. It also has constants for HTML Text and Start Playback extras that can be added to an `Intent`.

There is a `makeMainSelectorActivity` method, which creates an `Intent` that starts a new activity that is in a specific category. With this method, the behavior differs depending on the Android version. If the device runs on API 15 or higher, it uses the `makeMainSelectorActivity` method from the native `Intent` class. If it's lower, it creates a new `Intent` and manually adds the category.
