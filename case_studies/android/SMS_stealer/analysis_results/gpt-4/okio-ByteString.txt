The `ByteString` class represents an immutable sequence of bytes. The class provides various utility methods to perform operations on the byte sequence.

- The class contains static final constants, transient variables, and instance variables.
- It provides methods for encoding and decoding from strings to byte sequences and vice versa. It also provides methods to decode base64 and hexadecimal representations of a ByteString object.
- `hmac()` is a method that can generate a hashed message authentication code for ByteString using the provided algorithm.
- The class allows to create a ByteString object from a byte array or a ByteBuffer.
- The `ByteString` class also contains a method named `read()`, which reads bytes from an InputStream into a ByteString.
- `digest()` method is used to calculate the digest of ByteString using a specified algorithm.
- The `compareTo()` method can compare two ByteString objects. If two objects are equal then it will return 0, if the current object is larger it will return 1, otherwise it will return -1.
- The `asByteBuffer()` method returns a ByteBuffer that shares content with ByteString.
- The class provides methods like `base64()`, `base64Url()`, `hex()` which provides base64, URL safe base64 and hexadecimal string representation of ByteString respectively.
- The class implements the `Serializable` interface and defines methods for serialization and deserialization (`readObject()`, `writeObject()`).
- The `rangeEquals()` method checks if the range of bytes in ByteString is equal to the range of bytes in the given byte array.- The `hmacSha1()`, `hmacSha256()`, and `hmacSha512()` methods generate HMACs (Hash-based Message Authentication Codes) using the SHA1, SHA256, and SHA512 algorithms, respectively.
- The `indexOf()` methods search for the first occurrence of a given byte sequence in the ByteString object.
- The `lastIndexOf()` methods search for the last occurrence of a given byte sequence in the ByteString.
- The `md5()`, `sha1()`, `sha256(),` and `sha512()` methods calculate message digests using the MD5, SHA1, SHA256, and SHA512 hashing algorithms respectively.
- The `rangeEquals()` methods check if a given range in the ByteString matches a sequence of bytes.
- The `size()` method returns the size (the number of bytes) of ByteString.
- The `startsWith()` methods check if the ByteString begins with the provided sequence of bytes.
- The `string()` method makes a new String by decoding the ByteString as text with the given Charset.
- The `substring()` methods make a new ByteString that contains a subset of the bytes in this ByteString.
- The `toAsciiLowercase()` and `toAsciiUppercase()` methods return a new ByteString with all lowercase/uppercase ASCII characters converted to uppercase/lowercase.
- The `toByteArray()` returns a clone of the bytes in the ByteString.
- The `toString()` method returns a human-readable string that describes the ByteString.
- The `utf8()` method decodes the ByteString as UTF-8 encoded text.
- The `write()` methods write the ByteString to an OutputStream or a Buffer.
