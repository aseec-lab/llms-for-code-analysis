The `ErrorCode` enum defines a set of HTTP/2 protocol error codes such as `CANCEL`, `COMPRESSION_ERROR`, `CONNECT_ERROR`, among others. Each enumeration has an associated `httpCode`.

In the static block, different `ErrorCode` instances are created with their corresponding `httpCode` value. 

The enum also has a method `fromHttp2(int paramInt)` to return an instance of `ErrorCode` for a given HTTP/2 protocol error code. If the code is not defined, it returns null. This can be useful to translate an HTTP/2 protocol error code to a meaningful error message. This enumeration seems to be a part of the OkHttp library, a popular HTTP client for Java applications.
