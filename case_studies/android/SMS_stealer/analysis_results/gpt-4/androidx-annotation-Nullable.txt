The Nullable annotation is used to indicate that a null value can be accepted or expected in a particular position. It's part of the androidx.annotation package of the Android Jetpack library.

This annotation can be applied to methods, parameters, fields, local variables, annotation types, and packages. It signifies that the annotated element might be null under some circumstances.

For example, if a method is annotated with @Nullable, it indicates that this method could potentially return a null value. If a parameter of a method is annotated with @Nullable, it indicates that it's okay to pass a null value as an argument to this method.

Like other annotations, it doesn't enforce anything on its own but serves to help developers and tools catch or avoid nullability-related problems.
