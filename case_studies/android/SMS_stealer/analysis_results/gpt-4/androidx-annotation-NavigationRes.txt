The `@NavigationRes` is a type of annotation used in Android applications. AndroidX uses it to denote the ids of navigation resources, which are XML files defining the app's possible navigation paths. This annotation can be used on methods, parameters, fields, and local variables. 

`@Documented` annotation means it will be included in the JavaDoc. `@Retention(RetentionPolicy.CLASS)` means that the annotation will be recorded in the class file, but not needed at runtime. `@Target` is used to declare the annotation targets.

The following metadata is for Java Decompiler (JD-Core) and it doesn't affect the functionality of the `@NavigationRes` annotation.
