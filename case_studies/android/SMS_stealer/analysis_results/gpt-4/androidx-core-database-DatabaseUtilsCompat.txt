The `DatabaseUtilsCompat` class is a utility class that provides two main functionalities related to database operations.

1. `appendSelectionArgs(String[] paramArrayOfString1, String[] paramArrayOfString2)`: This method combines two string arrays which represent selection arguments for a SQL query in a database. It copies both arrays into a new array and returns it.

2. `concatenateWhere(String paramString1, String paramString2)`: This method concatenates two SQL WHERE clauses using the `AND` operator. It adds brackets around each clause for clarity and to avoid logical errors in SQL command.

Both methods are marked as deprecated which suggests that they are no longer recommended for use due to changes in the Android framework or the presence of better alternatives.
