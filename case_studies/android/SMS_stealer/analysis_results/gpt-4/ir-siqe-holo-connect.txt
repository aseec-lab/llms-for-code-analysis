The `connect` class appears to handle network connections to a specified URL, with the primary function being to send GET requests. It receives three parameters in its constructor: a URL, an information string, and a context.

In its constructor, `connect` uses `AndroidNetworking` to perform the GET request to the URL specified by the input parameters. It appends these parameters to the base URL for the request.

In case the first GET request produces an error (`onError` method), the code attempts to send another GET request to a different URL (notably "https://google.com"). It should be noted that the response to both GET requests isn't being utilized in this class (as seen in the empty `onResponse` methods).
