The `Reference` interface in Android is a part of the ConstraintLayout Solver library. It declares methods that are typically required for managing references to constraints in a `ConstraintLayout`.

The key methods in this interface are:

- `apply()`: This method is expected to apply the parameters of the reference.

- `getConstraintWidget()`: This method returns the `ConstraintWidget` associated with the reference.

- `setConstraintWidget(ConstraintWidget paramConstraintWidget)`: This method sets the `ConstraintWidget` for the reference.

- `getKey()`: This method retrieves the key object of the reference. The key could be used to uniquely identify the reference.

- `setKey(Object paramObject)`: This method sets the key object for the reference.
