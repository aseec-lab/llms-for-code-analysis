The `AppCompatTextClassifierHelper` class is a helper class for text classification in a `TextView`. The purpose of this class is to get and set the `TextClassifier` for a `TextView`. A `TextClassifier` is an object that provides and controls the selection behavior of the text.

Here is a summary of what this class does for its components:

1. `mTextClassifier`: An instance of `TextClassifier` which provides the information about the text.

2. `mTextView`: An instance of `TextView` for which text classification will be handled.

3. `AppCompatTextClassifierHelper(TextView paramTextView)`: A constructor that takes a `TextView` as a parameter and initializes the `mTextView` field.

4. `getTextClassifier()`: A getter method which returns the `TextClassifier` of the `TextView`. If the `TextClassifier` is null, it tries to retrieve it from `TextClassificationManager`. If `TextClassificationManager` is also null, it sets the `TextClassifier` to `TextClassifier.NO_OP`, which has no operations.

5. `setTextClassifier(TextClassifier paramTextClassifier)`: A setter method which sets the `TextClassifier` for the `TextView`.
