The `JsonDeserializer<T>` interface in the Gson library declares a method for custom deserialization of JSON elements.

Here's a brief rundown of what it does:

- It is a generic interface, indicated by `<T>`. This allows it to be used with any object type, not just specific ones. The Type `T` defines the type of Object to be deserialized.
  
- It declares a method `deserialize(JsonElement paramJsonElement, Type paramType, JsonDeserializationContext paramJsonDeserializationContext)`. This method is supposed to take a `JsonElement`, a `Type`, and a `JsonDeserializationContext`, and returns an instance of the type `T`.

- The `deserialize` method can throw a `JsonParseException`.
  
This interface should be implemented by those wishing to define a custom deserialization strategy for certain types in Gson. When Gson encounters a class that has this interface implemented, it will call the `deserialize` method to convert a JSON element back into the appropriate Java object.
