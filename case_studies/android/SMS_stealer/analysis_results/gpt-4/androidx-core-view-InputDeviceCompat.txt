The `InputDeviceCompat` class is a simple, final utility class that defines various constants representing different input device sources. These constants can be used to identify and categorize input events from devices such as buttons, joysticks, pointers, trackballs, keyboards, mice, touchpads, touchscreens, etc. There's also a constant for unknown or any source. These are typically used in context of handling user interactions through these devices.
