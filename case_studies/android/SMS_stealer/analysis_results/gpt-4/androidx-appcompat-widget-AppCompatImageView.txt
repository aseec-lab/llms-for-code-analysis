The `AppCompatImageView` is a custom `ImageView` that is compatible with older versions of Android. It includes many methods that allow for customization of the `ImageView` such as:

- Allows changing the tint of the `ImageView` background: `setSupportBackgroundTintList()` and `setSupportBackgroundTintMode()`.
- Allows changing the tint of the image source: `setSupportImageTintList()` and `setSupportImageTintMode()`.
- Overrides standard methods to ensure tinting is applied like `setBackgroundDrawable()`, `setBackgroundResource()`, `setImageBitmap()`, `setImageDrawable()`, `setImageResource()`, and `setImageURI()`.
- Provides getters for the various tint settings: `getSupportBackgroundTintList()`, `getSupportBackgroundTintMode()`, `getSupportImageTintList()`, and `getSupportImageTintMode()`.
- Handles state changes to the `ImageView` and applies the appropriate tinting.
  
The class utilizes two helper classes `AppCompatBackgroundHelper` and `AppCompatImageHelper` to provide the tinting functionality. These helper classes handle the loading of attributes, setting, and applying of the tint to the `ImageView`, as well as preserving the overlapping rendering settings for the `ImageView`.
