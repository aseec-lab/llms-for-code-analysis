The `AndroidViewModel` class is a subclass of the `ViewModel` class and is part of the Android lifecycle library. It's typically used for storing and managing UI-related data in a lifecycle conscious way.

It contains a constructor that receives an `Application` object and stores it in a local variable `mApplication`.

The class provides a `getApplication()` method that returns the stored `Application` object. The returned `Application` object can be used to access the application context in classes that extend `AndroidViewModel`. This is especially useful when the context is needed for Android framework classes such as `Context`, `SharedPreferences`, `Room`, and others.

The `AndroidViewModel` is a way to create a bridge between `ViewModel` and `Application`, providing access to the global application context. Typically, this global context might be needed to observe changes in system services or accessing resources.
