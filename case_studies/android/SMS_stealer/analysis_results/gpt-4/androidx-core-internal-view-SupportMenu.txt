The `SupportMenu` interface extends from the Menu interface and introduces some additional constants and methods for Android menus.

- `CATEGORY_MASK`, `CATEGORY_SHIFT`, `FLAG_KEEP_OPEN_ON_SUBMENU_OPENED`, `SUPPORTED_MODIFIERS_MASK`, `USER_MASK`, and `USER_SHIFT` are integer constants that can be used for defining how menu items in a `SupportMenu` interact with user inputs or interrelate with each other.

- `setGroupDividerEnabled(boolean)` is a method that, presumably, sets whether or not dividers should be shown between items in the same group within this menu. This method takes a boolean parameter; if it's true, dividers are enabled, if false, they are disabled.

Please note that as the actual Android source code or AndroidX library code is not available, the above assumptions are made based on the standard conventions followed in Android and may not be fully accurate.
