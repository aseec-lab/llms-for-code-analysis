`FontRes` is an annotation from the AndroidX library that's used to indicate that an `int` parameter, field, method return value or local variable is expected to be a Font resource reference (e.g., `R.font.some_font`). 

The annotation ensures that valid font resource references are provided where appropriate, which can help to catch potential bugs. 

The `@Retention(RetentionPolicy.CLASS)` annotation means that the annotation should be recorded in the class file by the compiler but need not be retained by the VM at run time. 

The `@Target` annotation indicates that this annotation can be used on methods, parameters, fields, or local variables.
