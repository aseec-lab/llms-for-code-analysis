1. `addObserver(LifecycleObserver paramLifecycleObserver)`: This abstract method must be implemented to add a LifecycleObserver.

2. `getCurrentState()`: This abstract method must be implemented to get the current state of the Lifecycle header.

3. `removeObserver(LifecycleObserver paramLifecycleObserver)`: This abstract method must be implemented to remove a LifecycleObserver.

4. `Event` enum: It defines the possible events for a lifecycle. It includes events like onCreate, onStart, onResume, onPause, onStop, onDestroy, and ON_ANY which refers to any lifecycle event.

5. `State` enum: It defines the possible states of a lifecycle. It includes states like DESTROYED, INITIALIZED, CREATED, STARTED, RESUMED. It also has a method `isAtLeast(State param1State)` to compare the current state with the supplied state.
