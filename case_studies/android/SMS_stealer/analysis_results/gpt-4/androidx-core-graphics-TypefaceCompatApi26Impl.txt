The `TypefaceCompatApi26Impl` class extends the `TypefaceCompatApi21Impl` class, adding compatibility for the Android API 26+. It provides an implementation to use new font APIs available from API 26 and above, while also maintaining backwards compatibility with older versions.

The class includes methods for:

- Creating new font families.
   - Checking if private APIs are available for the font family.
- Adding fonts from Asset Manager.
- Adding a font from a Buffer.
- Freezing the font object to prevent further addition of fonts to a particular font family.
- Creating a Typeface from the specific font family.
- Finding the best font information for creating a Typeface.
- Aborting Typeface creation.
- Creating Typeface from resources and font files.

This class uses reflection to use methods from the `android.graphics.FontFamily` class. If the reflection fails, it falls back to the superclass implementation, ensuring that the app doesn't crash on devices running Android API versions less than 26. 

In summary, `TypefaceCompatApi26Impl` is used to create a custom `Typeface` instance using the APIs introduced in Android 8.0 (API level 26) and maintaining backward compatibility.
