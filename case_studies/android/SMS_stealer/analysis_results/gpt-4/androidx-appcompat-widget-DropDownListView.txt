The `DropDownListView` class extends the Android `ListView` widget and customizes the behavior, specifically to support drop down lists in the user interface.

The member variables include flags to handle different focus and item selection states, padding for the selection, a selector drawable, a rectangle for keeping track of the selector boundaries, and several others.

The class provides a constructor that takes a `Context` and a boolean flag where it makes a ListView with drop-down styles and cache color to 0.

It exposes the method `clearPressedItem` to stop the drawing in pressed state on a particular list item, `clickPressedItem` to perform an item click action, `drawSelectorCompat` to draw the item selector into the designated area, `positionSelectorCompat` to position the selector, and others.

There are override methods for handling touch events and focus states (`hasFocus`, `hasWindowFocus`, `isFocused`, `isInTouchMode`) based on the variables `mHijackFocus` and `mListSelectionHidden`, `drawableStateChanged` for updating drawable state, `dispatchDraw` to draw the selector and list items, and `measureHeightOfChildrenCompat` to measure the total height occupied by children of the list view.

The method `lookForSelectablePosition` is to look for the next selectable position in the list. 

The nested classes/interfaces include `GateKeeperDrawable` which provides a way to control when the ListView's selector is drawn, `ResolveHoverRunnable` which provides a way to handle hover events, `ViewPropertyAnimatorCompat` that provides a platform agnostic way to use Android's view animation capabilities, and `ListViewAutoScrollHelper` which provides functionality to scroll a ListView.This section of the DropDownListView class includes additional methods and two nested classes, `GateKeeperDrawable` and `ResolveHoverRunnable`.

The `onDetachedFromWindow` method runs when the view is no longer attached to the window, it removes any instance of the `mResolveHoverRunnable` and calls its parent's `onDetachedFromWindow`.

`onForwardedEvent` is used to forward a motion event and perform appropriate operations accordingly based on touch and hover events. 

`onHoverEvent` method deals with hover events - hovering cursor in or out of an item, or moving the cursor around. 

`onTouchEvent` is overridden to handle the touch events. When action down is performed, it calculates the item position and if `mResolveHoverRunnable` is not null, it cancels it.

`setListSelectionHidden` sets the `mListSelectionHidden` flag.

`setSelector` sets the selector with a `GateKeeperDrawable` instance wrapping the Drawable passed into it if it’s not null, updates padding and sets the selector.

The `GateKeeperDrawable` nested class extends `DrawableWrapper`, primarily controlling the availability of hotspot and drawing operations. It has `setEnabled` method to control whether the Drawable will respond to state change and draw itself.

The `ResolveHoverRunnable nested class implements Runnable and it's responsible for invoking `drawableStateChanged` method in the DropDownListView when it’s executed. It has `cancel` and `post` methods for cancelling and posting the runnable.
