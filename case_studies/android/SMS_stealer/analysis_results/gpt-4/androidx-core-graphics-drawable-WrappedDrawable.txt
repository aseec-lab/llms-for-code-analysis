`WrappedDrawable` is an interface defining two methods: `getWrappedDrawable()` and `setWrappedDrawable(Drawable paramDrawable)`. 

The `getWrappedDrawable()` method is for retrieving the current `Drawable` object. The `setWrappedDrawable(Drawable paramDrawable)` method, on the other hand, is meant to set or replace the current `Drawable` object with the one provided as an argument (`paramDrawable`). 

These methods allow for getting and setting a `Drawable` object, likely providing a way to manipulate graphical data used in an application.
