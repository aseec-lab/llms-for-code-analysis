The `@IdRes` annotation is a marker annotation provided by the AndroidX library. This annotation is used to annotate parameters, methods, fields, and local variables that are expected to represent valid `id` resource references in Android (like a view's id in an XML layout file). This can be used by static analysis tools to validate correct usage.

The `@Retention(RetentionPolicy.CLASS)` annotation indicates that this annotation will be recorded in the class file by the compiler but need not be retained by the virtual machine at run time. 

The `@Target({ElementType.METHOD, ElementType.PARAMETER, ElementType.FIELD, ElementType.LOCAL_VARIABLE})` annotation means this annotation can be used on methods, parameters, fields, or local variables.

The trailing information is metadata related to the Java Decompiler (JD-Core) and doesn't impact the functionality of the annotation.
