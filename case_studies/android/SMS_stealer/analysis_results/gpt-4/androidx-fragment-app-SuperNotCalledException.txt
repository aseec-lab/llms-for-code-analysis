`SuperNotCalledException` is a custom exception class in the AndroidX Fragment library. It extends `AndroidRuntimeException`, meaning this is an unchecked exception.

The class is declared as final, which means it cannot be subclassed. It has a constructor that accepts a `String` parameter. This string is usually a message that provides additional details about the exception. It passes this string to the super class (`AndroidRuntimeException`) constructor.

This exception is usually thrown when a subclass in Android framework (fragments, activities, etc.) does not call the superclass's required methods. In those cases, `SuperNotCalledException` might be thrown to indicate the error.
