The `@FloatRange` annotation provided by Android is used to specify that a float or double value must be within a specified range. The annotation allows developers to declare the boundaries of this range by using `from` and `to` parameters. The `fromInclusive` and `toInclusive` parameters indicate whether the provided range is inclusive of the boundary values `from` and `to`. This annotation can be applied to methods, parameters, fields, local variables, and other annotation types. 

Specifically here, the default ranges are from negative to positive infinity, both inclusive.
