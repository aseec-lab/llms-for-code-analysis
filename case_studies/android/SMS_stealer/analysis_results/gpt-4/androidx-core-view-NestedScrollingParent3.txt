The `NestedScrollingParent3` interface in `androidx.core.view` package extends from `NestedScrollingParent2`. It defines a single method `onNestedScroll`.

The `onNestedScroll` method is typically involved in a scenario when a nested scroll (a scroll within a child view) is occurring. This method accepts parameters for the view initiating the scroll (`paramView`), the scroll distances along the x and y axes (`paramInt1` and `paramInt2`), the total scroll distances (`paramInt3` and `paramInt4`), the scroll type (`paramInt5`), and an array (`paramArrayOfint`) to store consumed scroll distances.

This interface acts as a contract for a view to be able to handle nested scrolling operations. Such behavior is significant for building complex layouts with scrollable nested interactable elements.
