The `DimensionDependency` class extends the `DependencyNode` class. In its constructor, it initiates the `DependencyNode` with `paramWidgetRun` and sets the type of `DependencyNode` based on `paramWidgetRun`'s type. If the `paramWidgetRun` is an instance of `HorizontalWidgetRun`, it sets the type to `HORIZONTAL_DIMENSION`; otherwise, it sets the type to `VERTICAL_DIMENSION`. 

The `resolve` method sets the `resolved` field to true and `value` to the input parameter if it's not resolved yet. Afterward, it calls the `update` method of each `Dependency` in `dependencies`. The `wrapValue` is declared without being used in the code shared.
