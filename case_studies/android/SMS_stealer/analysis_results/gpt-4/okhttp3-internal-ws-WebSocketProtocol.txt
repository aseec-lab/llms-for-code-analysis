The `WebSocketProtocol` class in OkHttp contains constants and methods that pertain to the WebSocket protocol.

Key methods include:

1. `acceptHeader()`: This method appends a string to the WebSocket's unique identifier, encodes it in UTF-8, hashes it using SHA-1, and encodes it to Base64. This method is typically used during the WebSocket handshake process.

2. `closeCodeExceptionMessage()`: This method produces an error message if the provided close code is not within the acceptable range. Certain codes are reserved in the WebSocket protocol and can't be utilized.

3. `toggleMask()`: This method performs XOR operation between data in the supplied buffer and a masking key. This is utilised in WebSocket's data masking procedure to maintain data privacy.

4. `validateCloseCode()`: This method checks if a provided close code is valid. If not, it throws an IllegalArgumentException.

Moreover, the class defines various constants to designate flags, opcodes, and payload lengths used in the WebSocket frame structure, establishing rules and restrictions for the WebSocket protocol.
