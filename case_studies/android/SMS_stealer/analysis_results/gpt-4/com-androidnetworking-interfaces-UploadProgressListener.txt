The `UploadProgressListener` interface is part of the `com.androidnetworking.interfaces` package. This interface declares a single method named `onProgress`.

`void onProgress(long paramLong1, long paramLong2);`: This method will be called to notify about the progress of an upload operation. It accepts two long parameters, typically representing the number of bytes uploaded and the total number of bytes to be uploaded, respectively.

Any class that implements `UploadProgressListener` must provide an implementation for this method. This method will typically be used to update the user interface with the upload progress.
