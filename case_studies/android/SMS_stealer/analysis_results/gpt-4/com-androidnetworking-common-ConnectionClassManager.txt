The `ConnectionClassManager` class manages the connection quality, maintaining an estimate of the device's current bandwidth and connection quality. This information is used to adapt responses and data transfers according to network connectivity.

Here are elements within this class:

- A singleton pattern is used for the class instantiation (`getInstance` method and `sInstance` variable).
- The `BANDWIDTH_LOWER_BOUND`, `BYTES_TO_BITS`, `DEFAULT_GOOD_BANDWIDTH`, `DEFAULT_MODERATE_BANDWIDTH`, `DEFAULT_POOR_BANDWIDTH`, `DEFAULT_SAMPLES_TO_QUALITY_CHANGE`, and `MINIMUM_SAMPLES_TO_DECIDE_QUALITY` are constant values defining the boundaries for bandwidth estimation. 
- The `mConnectionQualityChangeListener` instance variable and `setListener`/`removeListener` methods are for setting a listener to connectivity quality changes.
- The `updateBandwidth` method updates the bandwidth based on the amount of data transferred and the time taken. It also triggers the listener if the connection quality has changed.
- `getCurrentBandwidth` and `getCurrentConnectionQuality` methods provide access to the current estimated bandwidth and connection quality.
- `shutDown` method nullifies the singleton instance.
