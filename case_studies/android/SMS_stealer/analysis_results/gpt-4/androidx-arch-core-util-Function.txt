The `Function` interface in the AndroidX Arch Core library is a simple generic interface representing a function that takes an input and has an output. It has a single method `apply()` that accepts an input of type I and returns an output of type O.

This can be used to represent any operation that takes one input and returns an output, allowing you to use methods or operations as if they were objects.

As an interface, it is not used on its own, but should be implemented by a developer to define how a specific function should behave when it is called.
