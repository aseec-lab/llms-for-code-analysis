The `TintAwareDrawable` interface in the AndroidX Core library provides a contract for `Drawable` subclasses that support tinting, i.e., applying a color filter to the drawable's contents to change their color. It includes three methods:

1. `setTint(int paramInt)`: This method allows setting a tint color to the Drawable. The color is provided as an integer parameter.
   
2. `setTintList(ColorStateList paramColorStateList)`: This method allows setting a tint color list to the Drawable. The color list is represented as an instance of `ColorStateList`.
   
3. `setTintMode(PorterDuff.Mode paramMode)`: This method allows setting a tint blending mode (`PorterDuff.Mode`) to the Drawable.
   
Classes implementing this interface can be customized in their color behavior by applying different tints and blending modes.
