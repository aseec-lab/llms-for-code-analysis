The `MenuHelper` interface in the `androidx.appcompat.view.menu` package has only two methods:

- `dismiss()`: This method is used to dismiss or hide the menu.
- `setPresenterCallback(MenuPresenter.Callback paramCallback)`: This method allows setting a callback to a MenuPresenter.

Note: The `MenuHelper` interface is typically used by classes involved in creating, showing, or managing menus in an Android app. It provides a contract for these operations, which individual classes then implement.
