UserManagerCompat is a utility class containing one static method: `isUserUnlocked()`. This method checks if the current Android user is unlocked. This method works differently based on the operating system version:

- If the operating system is Android Nougat (API Level 24) or later, it uses the method `isUserUnlocked()` of `UserManager` (a system service class for managing users) to determine if the user is unlocked.

- If the operating system is earlier than Android Nougat, it assumes that the user is always unlocked and returns true.
