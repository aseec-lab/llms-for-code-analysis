The `banners.py` script appears to be used for generating random banner text in various styles to be displayed in the terminal.

1. The script defines several variables such as `figlet_ansi_shadow`, `figlet_big`, `figlet_bloody`, and so on. These variables are likely to contain different predefined `figlet` styles for the output text, although they are not defined in your given code.

2. The function `get_banner()` uses `random.choice()` to select a random `figlet` style from the variables list. It returns this style which likely changes the display style of the terminal text.

Based on the provided code, it seems this script is solely used for aesthetic purposes, likely to make a terminal or console look more appealing or unique when the botnet is running. `Figlet` is a tool that generates text banners in various typefaces composed of letters made up of conglomerations of smaller ASCII characters.
