The `Stealer.py` script defines the `Stealer` class, designed to steal sensitive information from a targeted machine and upload it to a specified server.

The class includes the following methods:

1. `steal_chrome_cookie`: Copies the Google Chrome cookies file to a temporary directory, uploads this copy to the server, and deletes the local copy. It logs the success or failure of the operation to the server.

2. `steal_firefox_cookie`: Similar to the first method but with Firefox cookies. It additionally handles the case where the Firefox browser is not installed.
   
3. `steal_bitcoin_wallet`: Attempts to find and upload the user's Bitcoin wallet file to the server. If it's not found, it logs the failure.

4. `steal_wifi_password`: This method extracts the SSID, authentication type, cipher, security key, and password for all wireless networks saved on the device. This information is written to a text file, which is then uploaded to the server and deleted locally.

In all cases, the completion of the task is indicated to the server by sending a "CleanCommands" message.

Hence, this class can be effectively used for illicit activities such as identity theft, cryptocurrency theft, and unauthorized use of personal internet connections.
