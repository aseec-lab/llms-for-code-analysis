`Base64_encrypt.py` is a Python script that encrypts a file using Base64 encoding.

Here's a step-by-step analysis:

1. The `Encrypt` class is initialized with plain text and encrypted text properties, both set as empty strings.

2. The `encrypt` method opens the user-provided file, reads each line, concatenates them into `self.text`, and then encodes `self.text` using Base64 to create `self.enc_txt`.

3. The method then replaces the contents of the original file with a single line of Python code that, when run, will decode the Base64 string back into the original code, thereby "decrypting" it.

4. In the script's main execution, it asks for a filename, invokes the `encrypt` method on that file, and finally prints a success message.
