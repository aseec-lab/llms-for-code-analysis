The `webpack.config.js` file is used for configuring Webpack, a popular static module bundler for JavaScript applications.

Here's what each part of the code does:

- The `mode: 'development'` switches Webpack to development mode, which offers debugging-related features like detailed error messages and the generation of source maps. The `devtool: 'inline-source-map'` keys in on what kind of source map to produce, in this case, it opts for inline source maps.

- The `entry` property specifies the entry points of the application: `background.js`, `popup.js`, and `content.js`. 

- The `output.path` property sets the location where the bundled files will be placed, in this case, the 'build' directory. The `output.filename` property specifies the naming structure of the created bundles.

- The `plugins` array is where plugins are added. It uses the `HtmlWebpackPlugin` to generate an HTML file that includes all your webpack bundles in the body using script tags. Also, the `CopyPlugin` is used to directly copy certain files from specified 'from' locations to 'to' locations when Webpack runs.

Basically, this configuration is used to specify how the project will be built and bundled utilizing Webpack, along with the paths for relevant files and actions to take during the process.
