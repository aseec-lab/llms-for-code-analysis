The given code comes from a `modeling.js` file in some sort of JavaScript project.

The code appears to be part of a machine learning pipeline powered by Xenova, a JavaScript machine learning library. It imports the `pipeline` and `env` methods from the `@xenova/transformers` package, and sets two environment variables.

In this code, a `PipelineSingleton` class is defined which appears to be a singleton-style pattern for managing the creation and maintenance of a Xenova machine learning pipeline instance.

The class has three static properties:
1. `task`: which is set to 'feature-extraction'
2. `model`: which is set to 'Xenova/all-MiniLM-L6-v2'
3. `instance`: set to null, intended to hold the singleton instance of the class.

The `getInstance` method creates a new pipeline instance if one doesn't exist yet and then returns that instance.

The `embed` function seems to take a pipeline instance and a text, use the pipeline to produce some output based on the text, and then return that output.

Finally, the `embed` function and the `PipelineSingleton` class are both exported for use in other parts of the application.
