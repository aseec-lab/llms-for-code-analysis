The `popup.js` script is responsible for the functioning of a search and indexing feature, like one you might find in a browser extension or similar application.

This script presents a user interface for entering a search query and viewing results. It also provides a clear button to reset the search input and the output. 

The search process involves sending a message with the query to the chrome runtime and updating the display based on the response. Also, to maintain a good user experience, it shows and hides loaders to indicate that search processing or indexing is taking place.

The search results are saved to the chrome storage sync area under the key 'librarian-saved-results' and are capable of being reopened, but they expire after a certain time (defaulting to 5 minutes).

There is also a function `checkIndexingStatus()` that checks whether any indexing is in progress and updates a progress bar accordingly. 

On loading of the window, it reopens any non-expired results, checks the indexing status immediately, and continues to check indexing status every 2 seconds.
