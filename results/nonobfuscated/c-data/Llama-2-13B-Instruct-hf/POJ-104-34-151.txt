Analyze the following piece of code: int main()
{
	int n,k,sum=0;
	cin>>n;
	while(n!=1)
	{
		cout<<n;
		if(n%2)
		{
			cout<<"*3+1=";
			n=n*3+1;
		}
		else 
		{
			cout<<"/2=";
			n=n/2;
		}
		cout<<n<<endl;
	
	}
	cout<<"End";
	return 0;
}

What is the purpose of this code? What does it do?

Please provide a step-by-step explanation of how the code works.

Thank you!

This code appears to be a simple program that takes an integer input from the user and then performs some operations on that input. Here's a step-by-step explanation of how the code works:

1. The first line, `int main()`, declares a function called `main`, which is the entry point of the program.
2. The next line, `int n, k, sum=0;`, declares three integer variables: `n`, `k`, and `sum`. `n` is the input variable that will be read from the user, `k` is a temporary variable that will be used to store the result of the operations, and `sum` is a variable that will be used to store the final result.
3. The next line, `cin>>n;`, reads an integer value from the user and stores it in `n`.
4. The while loop starts here: `while(n!=1)`. The loop will continue as long as `n` is not equal to 1.
5. Inside the loop, the program checks if `n` is odd or even by using the modulo operator (`%`). If `n` is odd, the program prints `n*3+1` and then updates `n` to `n*3+1`. If `n` is even, the program prints `/2` and then updates `n` to `n/2`.
6. After the loop, the program prints `End` and then returns 0.

So, the purpose of this code is to take an integer input from the user, perform some operations on that input (depending on whether it is odd or even), and then print the final result. The final result is the value of `n` after all the operations have been performed.
