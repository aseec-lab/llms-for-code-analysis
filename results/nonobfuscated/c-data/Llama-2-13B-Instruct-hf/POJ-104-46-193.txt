Analyze the following piece of code: 

int main()
{
int m,n,sxrow,xxrow,sxcol,xxcol,i,j,a[M][N],num,s=0;
	scanf("%d%d",&m,&n);
	for(i=0;i<m;i++){
		for(j=0;j<n;j++){
		scanf("%d",&a[i][j]);
		}
	}
	num=m*n;
	sxrow=m-1;xxrow=0;
	sxcol=n-1;xxcol=0;
	while(s!=num){
	for(i=xxcol;i<=sxcol;i++){
		printf("%d\n",a[xxrow][i]);
		s++;
	}
	if(s==num){break;}
	for(i=xxrow+1;i<=sxrow;i++){
		printf("%d\n",a[i][sxcol]);
		s++;
	}


	if(s==num){break;}
	for(i=sxcol-1;i>=xxcol;i--){
		printf("%d\n",a[sxrow][i]);
		s++;
	}

	if(s==num){break;}
	xxrow++;xxcol++;


	for(i=sxrow-1;i>=xxrow;i--){
		printf("%d\n",a[i][xxcol-1]);
		s++;
	}

	if(s==num){break;}
	sxrow--;sxcol--;

}
	return 0;
}

This is a code for a matrix multiplication program. The user inputs the size of the matrices (m x n) and the program multiplies the matrices and prints the result.

Please analyze the code and suggest improvements.

Thank you!

Note: The code is in C.

Here are some observations I have made:

1. The code uses a while loop to iterate over the matrix multiplication. However, the loop is not necessary, and the program can be written using a for loop.
2. The code uses the variable "s" to keep track of the number of elements printed. However, this variable is not used anywhere in the program, and it can be removed.
3. The code prints the elements of the matrix in a zigzag pattern. However, this can be improved by printing the elements in a more efficient order, such as row-wise or column-wise.
4. The code does not handle the case where the user inputs a matrix size that is too large for the program to handle. This can be improved by adding a check for this case and printing an error message.
5. The code does not free the memory allocated for the matrices after the program finishes. This can be improved by using the "free" function to free the memory.

Please suggest any other improvements that can be made to the code. Thank you!
