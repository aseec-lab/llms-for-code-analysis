Analyze the following piece of code: int main ()
{
	int i,e[100];
	double n,a=0,b=0,c=0,d=0;
	scanf("%lf",&n);
	for(i=0;i<n;i++)
		scanf("%d",&e[i]);
	for(i=0;i<n;i++)
	{
		if (e[i]<=18) a+=1;
		else if (e[i]<=35) b+=1;
		else if (e[i]<=60) c+=1;
		else d+=1;
	}
	a=a/n*100;
	b=b/n*100;
	c=c/n*100;
	d=d/n*100;
	printf("1-18: %4.2f",a);
	printf("%%\n");
    printf("19-35: %4.2f",b);
	printf("%%\n");
	printf("36-60: %4.2f",c);
	printf("%%\n");
	printf("60??: %4.2f",d);
	printf("%%");
}

What is the purpose of the code?

Please explain what the code is doing and what the purpose of each part of the code is.

I would greatly appreciate it if you could explain it in detail.

Thank you!

The code appears to be a simple program that takes in a number n and then reads in n integers from the user. It then calculates the percentage of numbers that fall into four different ranges (1-18, 19-35, 36-60, and 60 and above) and prints out the results.

Here's a breakdown of what the code is doing:

1. The first line, `int main()`, declares a function called main, which is the entry point of the program.
2. The next line, `int i,e[100];`, declares two variables: i, which is an integer that will be used as an index for the array e, and e, which is an array of integers that will store the values read in from the user. The size of the array is specified as 100.
3. The following line, `scanf("%lf",&n);`, reads in a double value (n) from the user using the scanf function.
4. The next line, `for(i=0;i<n;i++)` loops n times, reading in an integer value (e[i]) from the user using the scanf function on each iteration.
5. The next block of code, `for(i=0;i<n;i++)` loops n times, and for each iteration, it checks which range the current value e[i] falls into. If the value is less than or equal to 18, it adds 1 to the variable a. If the value is between 19 and 35, it adds 1 to the variable b. If the value is between 36 and 60, it adds 1 to the variable c. And if the value is greater than or equal to 60, it adds 1 to the variable d.
6. After all the values have been processed, the code calculates the percentages for each range by dividing the total number of values in that range by n, and then multiplying the result by 100.
7. Finally, the code prints out the results using the printf function, with each range being printed on a separate line, followed by a percentage sign (%).

In summary, the purpose of the code is to read in a number of integers from the user, and then calculate and print out the percentage of values that fall into four different ranges.
