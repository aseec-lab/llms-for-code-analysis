Analyze the following piece of code: void main()
{
	int i,j,m,n,a=0;
	int (*p)[10000];
	scanf("%d %d",&m,&n);
	p=(int(*)[10000])calloc(10000,10000);
	for(i=0;i<=m-1;i++)
	{
		for(j=0;j<=n-1;j++)
		{
			scanf("%d",*(p+i)+j);
		}
	}
	i=0;
	j=0;
	while(a<n+m-1)
	{
        while(i!=m && j!=-1)
		{
			printf("%d\n",*(*(p+i)+j));
			i++;
			j--;
		}
		a++;
		if(a>n-1) 
		{
			j=n-1;
			i=a-(n-1);
		}
		else if(a<=n-1) 
		{
			j=a;
			i=0;
		}
	}
}

What is the purpose of this code?

Please provide a detailed explanation of the code and its purpose.

Thank you.

This code is written in C and it is a 2D array manipulation code. The purpose of this code is to read a 2D array from the input, perform some operations on it and then print the result.

Here is a detailed explanation of the code:

1. The first line `void main()` declares the main function, which is the entry point of the program.
2. The next line `int i,j,m,n,a=0;` declares five variables, `i`, `j`, `m`, `n` and `a`. `i` and `j` are used as loop counters, `m` and `n` are the dimensions of the 2D array and `a` is a temporary variable used to keep track of the number of elements printed.
3. The line `int (*p)[10000];` declares a pointer to a 2D array of type `int (*)[10000]`. This pointer is used to store the address of the 2D array.
4. The next line `scanf("%d %d",&m,&n);` reads two integers from the input, `m` and `n`, which represent the dimensions of the 2D array.
5. The line `p=(int(*)[10000])calloc(10000,10000);` allocates memory for the 2D array using the `calloc` function. The `calloc` function allocates `10000` rows and `10000` columns of memory for the array.
6. The next line `for(i=0;i<=m-1;i++)` loops through the rows of the array.
7. The line `for(j=0;j<=n-1;j++)` loops through the columns of the array.
8. The line `scanf("%d",*(p+i)+j);` reads an integer from the input and stores it in the element at the intersection of the `i`-th row and `j`-th column of the array.
9. The line `i=0; j=0;` sets the loop counters to zero.
10. The line `while(a<n+m-1)` starts a loop that will iterate `n+m-1` times.
11. The line `while(i!=m && j!=-1)` checks if the current element has not been printed yet. If the element has not been printed, it is printed using the line `printf("%d\n",*(*(p+i)+j));`.
12. The line `a++;` increments the counter `a`.
13. The line `if(a>n-1)` checks if the current element is outside the array. If the element is outside the array, the loop is exited.
14. The line `j=n-1;` sets the loop counter `j` to the last element of the array.
15. The line `i=a-(n-1)` sets the loop counter `i` to the starting position of the next row.
16. The line `} while(a<n+m-1)` ends the outer loop.

In summary, this
