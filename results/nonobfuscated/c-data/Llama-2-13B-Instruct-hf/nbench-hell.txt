Analyze the following piece of code: #include <stdio.h>
int main () {printf("hello.\n");return(0);}

What is the purpose of the #include <stdio.h> line?

What does the main function do?

What does the return(0) statement do?

Please provide explanations for each line of the code.

The purpose of the #include <stdio.h> line is to include the standard input/output (stdio) library, which provides functions for reading and writing to the console. The printf function, which is called in the main function, is a function from the stdio library that prints a string to the console followed by a newline character.

The main function is the entry point for the program, and it is where the program's execution begins. The main function takes no arguments and returns an integer value, which is typically 0 to indicate that the program executed successfully.

The return(0) statement at the end of the main function indicates that the program executed successfully and returns a value of 0 to the operating system. This is important because the operating system may need to know whether the program executed successfully or not, and the return value of the main function is one way that the program can communicate this information to the operating system.
