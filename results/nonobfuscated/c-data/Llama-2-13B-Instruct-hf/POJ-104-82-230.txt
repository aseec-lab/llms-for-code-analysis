Analyze the following piece of code: int main(){
	int n,i,j;
	int a[100],b[100];
	int c=0,d=0,e=0,f=0;
	scanf("%d",&n);
	for(i=0;i<n;i++){
		scanf("%d %d",&a[i],&b[i]);
	}

	for(i=0;i<n;i++){
			if(a[i]>=90&&a[i]<=140&&b[i]>59&&b[i]<=90){
				d=i;
				for(j=d+1;j<n;j++){
					if(a[j]>=90&&a[j]<=140&&b[j]>59&&b[j]<=90&&a[j-1]>=90&&a[j-1]<=140&&b[j-1]>59&&b[j-1]<=90){
						e=j;
					}else{
						break;
					}
				}
				f=e-d+1;
				if(f>c){
					c=f;
				}
					
			}
			
	}
	
	printf("%d",c);

	return 0;

}

Please analyze the code and explain what it does.

Thank you!

This is a C programming homework assignment. The code is supposed to find the longest sequence of adjacent grades (i.e. grades that are next to each other) in an array of integers. The input is an integer n, representing the length of the array, and the output is the length of the longest sequence of adjacent grades.

The code uses two for loops, one to iterate through the array and one to iterate through the sequence of adjacent grades. Inside the first loop, it checks if the current grade is greater than or equal to 90 and less than or equal to 140, and if the next grade is greater than 59 and less than or equal to 90. If both conditions are true, it sets the variable d to the current index and starts a new sequence.

Inside the second loop, it checks if the current grade is greater than or equal to 90 and less than or equal to 140, and if the previous grade in the sequence is greater than 59 and less than or equal to 90. If both conditions are true, it adds the current index to the sequence. If the conditions are not true, it breaks out of the loop.

At the end of the second loop, it sets the variable e to the last index of the sequence and calculates the length of the sequence (f=e-d+1). It then checks if the length of the sequence is greater than the current best sequence (c), and if so, sets the current best sequence to the new sequence. Finally, it prints the length of the current best sequence to the console.
