Analyze the following piece of code: void main()
{
	char *s1,*s2;
	int i,len;
	s1=(char*)malloc(100*sizeof(char));
	s2=(char*)malloc(100*sizeof(char));
	gets(s1);
	len=strlen(s1);
	for(i=0;i<len-1;i++)
		*(s2+i)=*(s1+i)+*(s1+i+1);
		*(s2+len-1)=*(s1)+*(s1+len-1);
		for(i=0;i<len;i++)
			printf("%c",*(s2+i));
}

What are the potential issues with this code?

Hint: There are at least 2 potential issues with this code.

Please provide a detailed analysis of the code, pointing out the potential issues and suggesting improvements.

Note: The code is a simplified version of a program that takes a string as input and reverses it.

This is a homework assignment, and I'm looking for a detailed analysis of the code, not just a list of potential issues. Please provide a thorough analysis of the code and suggest improvements.

Thank you!

Here's my analysis:

1. The first potential issue with the code is the use of the `gets` function, which is a dangerous and deprecated function that can lead to buffer overflows. The `gets` function does not perform any bounds checking on the input, and it is possible to enter more data than the buffer can hold, leading to a buffer overflow.

To fix this issue, the code should use the `fgets` function instead, which allows the user to specify a maximum number of characters to read. For example, the following code uses `fgets` to read a line of input from the user, and it sets a maximum length of 100 characters:

void main()
{
	char *s1,*s2;
	int i,len;
	s1=(char*)malloc(100*sizeof(char));
	fgets(s1, 100, stdin);
	len=strlen(s1);
	for(i=0;i<len-1;i++)
		*(s2+i)=*(s1+i)+*(s1+i+1);
		*(s2+len-1)=*(s1)+*(s1+len-1);
		for(i=0;i<len;i++)
			printf("%c",*(s2+i));
}

2. The second potential issue with the code is the use of the `malloc` function to allocate memory for the strings `s1` and `s2`. The `malloc` function can return a null pointer if there is not enough memory available, which would cause the program to crash.

To fix this issue, the code should use the `calloc` function instead, which initializes the memory to zero. For example, the following code uses `calloc` to allocate memory for the strings `s1` and `s2`:

void main()
{
	char *s1,*s2;
	int i,len;
	s1=calloc(100, sizeof(char));
	s2=calloc(100, sizeof(char));
	fgets(s1, 100, stdin);
	len=strlen(s1);
	for(i=0;i<len-1;i++)
		*(s2+i)=*(s1+i)+*(s1+i+1);
		*(s2+len-1)=*(s1)+*(s1+len-1);
		for(i=0;i<len;i++)
			printf("%c",*(s2+i));
}

Additionally, the code should check the return value of `calloc` to ensure that memory was allocated successfully. For example, the following code checks the return value
