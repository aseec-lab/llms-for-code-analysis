What is the purpose of this code?

This code appears to be a simple program that takes an integer input from the user and then prints out the values of certain integers based on the value of the input.

The purpose of this code is to find the values of the numbers that are multiples of 5 and 7.

The code uses a series of if statements to check if the input number is a multiple of 5 or 7, and if it is, it prints out the current loop index (i).

The code also uses the modulo operator (%) to check if the input number is a multiple of 7, and the remainder operator (%) to check if the input number is a multiple of 5.
