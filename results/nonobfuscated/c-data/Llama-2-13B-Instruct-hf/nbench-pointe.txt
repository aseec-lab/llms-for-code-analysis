Analyze the following piece of code: #include <stdio.h>
int main(){
 printf("%d",(int)sizeof(long));
 return(0);
}

What will be the output of this code?

I'm having trouble understanding the syntax of the line:
printf("%d",(int)sizeof(long));

Can you explain it to me?

Also, what is the purpose of the cast to (int) in the line:
(int)sizeof(long);

I'm new to C programming and I'm trying to learn. Any help would be greatly appreciated!

Thank you!
