Analyze the following piece of code: 
struct student{
	char num[100];
	char name[100];
	char sex;
	int old;
	float score;
	char add[150];
	struct student *next;
};

void main()
{
	struct student *p1,*p2;
	int len=sizeof(struct student);
	p1=(struct student *)malloc(len);
	p1->next=NULL;
	scanf("%s",p1->num);
	while(strcmp(p1->num,"end")!=0){
		scanf("%s %c %d %g %s",p1->name,&p1->sex,&p1->old,&p1->score,p1->add);
		p2=p1;
		p1=(struct student *)malloc(len);
		p1->next=p2;
		scanf("%s",p1->num);
	}
	while(p1->next!=NULL){
		p1=p1->next;
		printf("%s %s %c %d %g %s\n",p1->num,p1->name,p1->sex,p1->old,p1->score,p1->add);
	}
}

Please provide a detailed answer.

The code is a simple student management system. It allows the user to add, view, and remove students from the system.

Potential issues with the code:

1. Memory leaks: The code uses `malloc` to allocate memory for the `struct student` array, but it does not free the memory when the student is removed from the system. This can lead to memory leaks over time.
2. Lack of error handling: The code does not handle errors when reading from the user or when allocating memory. This can lead to the program crashing or producing incorrect output.
3. Insecure data storage: The code stores sensitive information such as names, addresses, and scores in a plain text format. This can be a security risk if the data is not properly protected.

To improve the code:

1. Use smart pointers: Instead of using `malloc` and `free`, use smart pointers such as `unique_ptr` and `shared_ptr` to manage the memory. This can help prevent memory leaks and make the code more readable.
2. Implement error handling: Add error handling to the code to handle situations when the user enters invalid data or when there is an error reading from the user.
3. Use secure data storage: Instead of storing sensitive information in plain text, use secure data storage methods such as encryption to protect the data.
4. Use a more robust data structure: Instead of using a linked list, use a more robust data structure such as a tree or a graph to store the student data. This can make the code more efficient and easier to maintain.
5. Add validation: Add validation to the code to ensure that the user enters valid data. For example, validate that the name and address are not empty, and that the score is a valid floating point number.
6. Use a more robust input method: Instead of using `scanf`, use a more robust input method such as `fgets` and `sscanf` to read from the user. This can help prevent errors when the user enters invalid data.
