Analyze the following piece of code: 
int main(){
	int n=0,i=0,j=0,p=0,q=0,r=0; //??6???????????0
	cin>>n; //??n
	int a[n],b[n]; //??????
	for(;i<n;i++) cin>>a[i]; //????a[n]????
	for(;j<n;j++){ //????
		p=0; //?????
		q=1; //?????
		for(b[j]=0;b[j]<a[j]-1;b[j]++){ //1?a[j]-1????
			r=p; //????????r
			p=q; //???????????
			q+=r; //?????
		}
		cout<<q<<endl; //?????n??
	}
	return 0;
}

Please explain the purpose of this code and what it does.

Hint: It's a simple program that takes an integer as input and then prints a series of numbers.
