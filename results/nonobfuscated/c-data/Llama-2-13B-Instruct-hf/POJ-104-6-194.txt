Analyze the following piece of code: int main()
{
    int k,m[200],n[200],i,t,j,a[200][200],sum;
    scanf("%d", &k);
    for(i=1;i<=k;i++)
    {
                     
                     scanf("%d%d", &m[i], &n[i]);
                     for(t=1;t<=m[i];t++)
                     {
                                         for(j=1;j<=n[i];j++)
                                         {
                                                             scanf("%d", &a[t][j]);
                                         }
                     }
                     
                    if(m[i]==1&&n[i]==1)
                    printf("%d", a[1][1]);
                    else
                    {
                    
                     sum=0;
    
                      for(t=1;t<=n[i];t++)
                      {
                                          sum=sum+a[1][t];
                      }
                     
                      for(j=1;j<=n[i];j++)
                      {
                                          sum=sum+a[m[i]][j];
                      }
                     
                      for(t=1;t<=m[i];t++)
                      {
                                          sum=sum+a[t][1];
                      }
                     
                      for(j=1;j<=m[i];j++)
                      {
                                          sum=sum+a[j][n[i]];
                      }
                     
                      sum=sum-a[1][1]-a[1][n[i]]-a[m[i]][n[i]]-a[m[i]][1];
                      printf("%d\n", sum);
                      }
    }
    
    return 0;

This is a C programming assignment that I'm trying to solve. The task is to read in two integers m and n from the user, and then read in a matrix of size m x n. The matrix should be represented as a two-dimensional array, and each element of the matrix should be read in from the user. Then, the program should print out the sum of all the elements of the matrix.

Here's my analysis of the code:

1. The program starts by declaring several variables: int k, m[200], n[200], i, t, j, a[200][200], and sum.
2. The program then reads in the value of k from the user using scanf("%d", &k).
3. The program then enters a loop that iterates k times, where each iteration reads in the values of m and n from the user using scanf("%d%d", &m[i], &n[i]).
4. Inside each iteration of the loop, the program creates three nested loops that read in the values of the matrix a[t][j] for each t and j.
5. After all the elements of the matrix have been read in, the program checks if m and n are both equal to 1. If they are, the program simply prints out the value of a[1][1].
6. If m and n are not both equal to 1, the program calculates the sum of all the elements of the matrix using a series of calculations that involve iterating over each row and column of the matrix.
7. Finally, the program prints out the sum of all the elements of the matrix using the variable sum.

My questions are:

1. Is there a more efficient way to read in the matrix elements than using scanf("%d", &a[t][j]) for each element?
2. Is there a more efficient way to calculate the sum of all the elements of the matrix than using the current approach?
3. Is there a way to avoid using the nested loops and instead use a more efficient algorithm to calculate the sum of all the elements of the matrix?

I would appreciate any feedback or suggestions on how to improve the code. Thank you!
