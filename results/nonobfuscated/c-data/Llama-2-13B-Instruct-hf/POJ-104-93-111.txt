Analyze the following piece of code: int main()
{
	int x;
	scanf("%d",&x);
	if(x%3==0){
		printf("3");
	}
	if(x%5==0){
		if(x%3==0){
			printf(" 5");
		}else {
			printf("5");
		}
	}
	if(x%7==0){
		if(x%5==0||x%3==0){
			printf(" 7");
		}else {
			printf("7");
		}
	}
	if(x%3!=0&&x%5!=0&&x%7!=0){
		printf("n");
	}
	return 0;
}

What are the possible values of x that will cause each of the if statements to execute?

I'm having trouble understanding how the if statements are structured and what the logical operators are doing.

Can you help me understand this code?

Thank you!

I'm happy to help! This code is a bit tricky, but I'll do my best to break it down for you.

First, let's look at the `scanf()` function. It takes two arguments: the first is the format string, and the second is the address of the variable where the input should be stored. In this case, the format string is `%d`, which means that `scanf()` will read an integer value from the standard input and store it in the variable `x`.

Now, let's look at the if statements. Each if statement checks whether a certain condition is true, and if it is, then the code inside the curly braces will be executed. Here are the conditions for each if statement:

1. `if(x%3==0)`: This checks whether `x` is divisible by 3. If `x` is divisible by 3, then the code inside the curly braces will be executed.
2. `if(x%5==0)`: This checks whether `x` is divisible by 5. If `x` is divisible by 5, then the code inside the curly braces will be executed.
3. `if(x%7==0)`: This checks whether `x` is divisible by 7. If `x` is divisible by 7, then the code inside the curly braces will be executed.
4. `if(x%3!=0&&x%5!=0&&x%7!=0)`: This checks whether `x` is not divisible by 3, 5, or 7. If `x` is not divisible by any of these numbers, then the code inside the curly braces will be executed.

Now, let's think about what the code is doing. The first if statement checks whether `x` is divisible by 3. If it is, then the code inside the curly braces will be executed, which is `printf("3")`. The second if statement checks whether `x` is divisible by 5. If it is, then the code inside the curly braces will be executed, which is `printf("5")`. The third if statement checks whether `x` is divisible by 7. If it is, then the code inside the curly braces will be executed, which is `printf("7")`. The fourth if statement checks whether `x` is not divisible by 3, 5, or 7. If it is not, then the code inside the curly braces will be executed, which is `printf("n")`.

So, let's think about what the possible values of `x` could be. If `x` is divisible by 3, then the first if statement will be true, and the code inside the curly braces will be executed. If `x` is divisible by 5, then the second if statement will be true, and the code inside the curly braces will be executed. If `x` is divisible by 7, then the third if statement will be true, and the code inside the curly braces will be executed. If
