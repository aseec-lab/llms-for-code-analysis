Analyze the following piece of code: int main()
{
	double a[1000],sum,q;
	int b,c,d[1000],j,k,l,n,i;
	b=2;
	c=1;
	a[0]=(double)b/c;
	scanf("%d",&n);
	for(i=0;i<n;i++)
	{
		scanf("%d",&d[i]);
	}
	for(i=0;i<n;i++)
	{
		sum=a[0];
		b=2;
		c=1;
		for(j=1;j<d[i];j++)
		{
			
			k=b;
			b=(b+c);
			c=k;
			a[j]=(double)b/c;
			sum=sum+a[j];
		}
		q=sum;
		printf("%.3lf\n",q);
	}
	return 0;
}

What are the following things in this code?

1. What is the purpose of the variable 'b' and 'c'?
2. What is the purpose of the array 'a'?
3. What is the purpose of the variable 'n'?
4. What is the purpose of the two for loops?
5. What is the purpose of the variable 'j'?
6. What is the purpose of the variable 'k'?
7. What is the purpose of the expression 'b+c'?
8. What is the purpose of the expression 'k=b'?
9. What is the purpose of the expression 'c=k'?
10. What is the purpose of the statement 'a[j]=(double)b/c;'?
11. What is the purpose of the statement 'sum=sum+a[j];'?
12. What is the purpose of the statement 'q=sum;'?
13. What is the purpose of the statement 'printf("%.3lf\n",q);'?
