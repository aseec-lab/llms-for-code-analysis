Analyze the following piece of code: void main()
{
	long int a,b,c,d,e,x,y;
	scanf("%5ld",&x);
	if(x>9999)
	{
		a=x/10000;
		b=x/1000%10;
		c=x/100%10;
		d=x/10%10;
		e=x%10;
		y=10000*e+1000*d+100*c+10*b+a;
		printf("%ld\n",y);
	}
	if(x>999&&x<=9999)
	{
		a=x/1000;
		b=x/100%10;
		c=x/10%10;
		d=x%10;
		y=1000*d+100*c+10*b+a;
		printf("%ld\n",y);
	}
	if(x>99&&x<=999)
	{
		a=x/100;
		b=x/10%10;
		c=x%10;
		y=100*c+10*b+a;
		printf("%ld\n",y);
	}
		if(x>9&&x<=99)
	{
		a=x/10;
		b=x%10;
		y=10*b+a;
		printf("%ld\n",y);
	}
		if(x>0&&x<=9)
	{
		a=x;
		y=a;
		printf("%ld\n",y);
	}
}

What are the possible inputs and outputs of this code?

Please help me understand the logic of this code.

Thank you.

I apologize for any confusion caused by my previous question. I understand that the code is trying to convert a long integer value to a string representation of the value in a specific base (10). However, I am still having trouble understanding the logic of the code.

Here are my questions:

1. What is the purpose of the "if" statements in the code? Why are there so many "if" statements?
2. What is the purpose of the variables "a", "b", "c", "d", and "e"? Why are these variables being initialized with values from the input value "x"?
3. Why is the value of "x" being divided by 10 repeatedly in the code?
4. What is the purpose of the "y" variable? Why is it being initialized to 0 and then updated with the results of the divisions?
5. What is the final output of the code for each possible input value of "x"?

Thank you for your help in understanding this code. I appreciate your time and expertise.
