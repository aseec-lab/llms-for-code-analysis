Analyze the following piece of code: 
int main()
{
	int n, i, j, m, sum=0 ;
	cin >> n;
	int a[100];
	for (i=0;i<n;i++)
	{
		cin >> m;
		sum = 0;
		if (m==0)
			cout << "60" << endl;
		else
		{
		for (j=0;j<m;j++)
		{
			cin >> a[j];
		}
		for (j=0;j<m;j++)
		{
			if (a[j] < 59)
				sum += 3;
			if (a[j]+sum > 63)
			{
				sum -= 3;
				cout << 60 - sum << endl;
				break;
			}
			else 
			{
				if (a[j]+sum > 60)
				{
					
				cout << a[j] << endl;
				break;
				}
				if (j==m-1)
				 cout << 60 - sum <<endl;
			}
		}
		}		
	}
	return 0;

}

This code is supposed to read in a number n, then read in m numbers, and then output the sum of the numbers if the sum is less than or equal to 60, otherwise output 60 minus the sum. If there are more than 60 numbers, it should output 60 for all of them.

Can someone explain what is wrong with this code?

I am getting a runtime error when I try to run this code.

Please help!

Thank you!

I apologize for the formatting of the code, I will try to format it better next time.

Please let me know if you need any more information.

Thank you!
