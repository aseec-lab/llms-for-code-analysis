Analyze the following piece of code: main()
{
    int a[21][21];
    int i,j,k,m,n;
    for(i=0;i<21;i++)
     for(j=0;j<21;j++)
      a[i][j]=0;
    scanf("%d %d",&m,&n);
    for(i=1;i<m+1;i++)
     for(j=1;j<n+1;j++)
      scanf("%d",&a[i][j]);
    for(i=1;i<m+1;i++)
     {
         for(j=1;j<n+1;j++)
          {
              if(a[i][j]>=a[i-1][j]&&a[i][j]>=a[i][j-1]&&a[i][j]>=a[i+1][j]&&a[i][j]>=a[i][j+1])
                printf("%d %d\n",i-1,j-1);
          }
     }



}

What are the time and space complexity of this code?

Please provide a detailed analysis.

Hint: Think about the loops, array accesses, and input/output operations.

This is a homework problem, so I'd like to avoid any direct solutions or hints. Instead, I'd like to guide you through the analysis process.

Let's start by analyzing the time complexity.

What can you say about the number of iterations of the inner loops? How many times will each of them be executed?
