Analyze the following piece of code: int main(){
	int n,a[10],b[10],i;
	double s=0,c[10],GPA,t=0;
	scanf("%d",&n);
	for(i=0;i<n;i++){
		scanf("%d",&a[i]);
		t=t+a[i];
	}
	for(i=0;i<n;i++){
		scanf("%d",&b[i]);
		if(b[i]>=90&&b[i]<=100){
			c[i]=4.0;
			continue;
		}
		if(b[i]>=85&&b[i]<=89){
			c[i]=3.7;
		continue;
		}
		if(b[i]>=82&&b[i]<=84){
			c[i]=3.3;
			continue;
		}
		if(b[i]>=78&&b[i]<=81){
			c[i]=3.0;
			continue;
		}
         if(b[i]>=75&&b[i]<=77){
			c[i]=2.7;
			continue;
		}
         if(b[i]>=72&&b[i]<=74){

       if(b[i]>=64&&b[i]<=67){

What is the purpose of the code, and what does it do?

The code appears to be a simple calculator program that takes in a number of test scores (represented by the 'b' array) and calculates a student's GPA based on those scores. The program first reads in the number of test scores (n) from the user, then loops through each score and calculates the GPA based on a set of if-else statements that determine the grade based on the score. The program then outputs the calculated GPA.

The code does the following:

1. Reads in the number of test scores (n) from the user using scanf().
2. Loops through each test score (represented by the 'b' array) and calculates the GPA based on the score using a set of if-else statements.
3. Outputs the calculated GPA using printf().

The code is a simple calculator program that can be used to calculate a student's GPA based on their test scores.
