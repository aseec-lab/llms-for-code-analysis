Analyze the following piece of code: void main()
{
	double mian(double a,double b,double c,double d,double j);
	double a,b,c,d,j,s;
	scanf("%lf%lf%lf%lf%lf",&a,&b,&c,&d,&j);
	s=mian(a,b,c,d,j);
	if(s==0)printf("Invalid input");
	else printf("%.4lf",s);
}
double mian(double a,double b,double c,double d,double j)
{
  double q,w,s,e;
  q=j/2/180*3.1415926;
  s=(a+b+c+d)/2;
  w=(s-a)*(s-b)*(s-c)*(s-d)-a*b*c*d* cos(q)*cos(q);
  if(w<0)return(0);
  else
  {
	  e=sqrt(w);
  return(e);
  }
}

Please analyze the code and point out the following:

1. What is the purpose of the function mian()?
2. What are the inputs and outputs of the function mian()?
3. What is the purpose of the variable j in the main() function?
4. What is the purpose of the variable s in the main() function?
5. What is the purpose of the variable e in the mian() function?
6. What is the purpose of the statement "if(w<0)return(0);" in the mian() function?
7. What is the purpose of the statement "else return(e);" in the mian() function?
8. What is the purpose of the statement "printf("%.4lf",s);" in the main() function?
9. What is the purpose of the statement "if(s==0)printf("Invalid input");" in the main() function?
10. What is the purpose of the statement "scanf("%lf%lf%lf%lf%lf",&a,&b,&c,&d,&j);" in the main() function?
