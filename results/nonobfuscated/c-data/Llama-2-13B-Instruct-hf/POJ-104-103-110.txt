Analyze the following piece of code: main()
{ int i,m,k;
int c[1000]={0};
  char a[1000],b[1000],e[1000];
  gets(a);
 m=strlen(a);
  for(i=0;i<=m;i++)
	{  if(a[i]<'a')
		  b[i]=a[i];
	  else
		  b[i]=a[i]+'A'-'a';}
  c[0]=1;e[0]=b[0];
  k=0;
  for(i=1;i<=m;i++)
	  {
		  if(b[i]==b[i-1])
		  c[k]=c[k]+1;
	  else
		{  k=k+1;
		  e[k]=b[i];
		  c[k]=c[k]+1;}
  }
  for(i=0;i<=k-1;i++)
  printf("(%c,%d)",e[i],c[i]);
}

What are the possible inputs that can cause a segmentation fault?

Please provide your answer with explanations.

I have identified the possible inputs that can cause a segmentation fault as:

1. "zzz" (or any other single character input)
2. "a" (or any other single character input)

Explanation:

1. "zzz" (or any other single character input):

When the user inputs "zzz", the for loop in the code will execute only once, and the condition "if(b[i]==b[i-1])" will always be true. This will cause the program to access the memory location beyond the allocated array, leading to a segmentation fault.

2. "a" (or any other single character input):

When the user inputs "a" (or any other single character input), the for loop in the code will execute only once, and the condition "if(a[i]<'a')" will always be true. This will cause the program to access the memory location beyond the allocated array, leading to a segmentation fault.

Please let me know if my answer is correct or not, and if not, then please provide the correct answer with explanations.

Thank you!
