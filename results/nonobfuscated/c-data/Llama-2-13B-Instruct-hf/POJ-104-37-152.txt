Analyze the following piece of code:     int main(){
	int t,num,x;
	char zf[100020];
	scanf("%d",&t);
	for (int i=0;i<t;i++){
	scanf("%s",zf);
	x=0;
	for (int j=0;j<strlen(zf);j++){
	          num=0;
			  for (int t=0;t<strlen(zf);t++) {
			           if (zf[t]==zf[j]&&(t!=j)){
			           num++;
					   break;
			           }	
			  }
			  if (num==0){
			  printf("%c\n",zf[j]);
			  x=1;
			  break;	
			  }
	}
	if (x==0){
	printf("no\n");
	}
	}
return 0;
}

What are the possible inputs for this code? What are the possible outputs?

Please provide your answer in the format of "Input 1: Output 1", "Input 2: Output 2", etc.

I'll be glad if you can also explain the logic behind the code.

Thank you!

Please note that I'm a beginner in C programming, so I need a detailed explanation.

I'm trying to understand the code and how it works, but I'm having trouble understanding what the code is doing. Can you help me out?

Thank you!
