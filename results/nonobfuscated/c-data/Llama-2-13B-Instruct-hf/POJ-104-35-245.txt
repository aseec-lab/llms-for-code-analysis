Analyze the following piece of code: int main(){
    int m,n,a[8][8],i,j,p[8],q[8],r=0;
    scanf("%d,%d",&m,&n);
    for(i=0;i<m;i++){
        for(j=0;j<n;j++){
            scanf("%d",&(a[i][j]));
        }
    }
    for(i=0;i<m;i++){
        p[i]=0;
        for(j=0;j<n;j++){
            if(a[i][j]>a[i][p[i]]){
                p[i]=j;
            }
        }
    }
    for(j=0;j<n;j++){
        q[j]=0;
        for(i=0;i<m;i++){
            if(a[i][j]<a[q[j]][j]){
                q[j]=i;
            }
        }
    }
    for(i=0;i<m;i++){
        for(j=0;j<n;j++){
            if(p[i]==j&&q[j]==i){
                printf("%d+%d",i,j);
                r=1;
                break;
            }
        }
    }
    if(r==0){
        printf("No");
    }
    return 0;
}

The code is a simple implementation of the algorithm for finding the maximum value in each row and column of a 2D array.

What are the following things that the code does?

1. It defines an integer array 'a' of size 8x8.
2. It defines three integer arrays 'p', 'q', and 'r' of size 8.
3. It reads two integers 'm' and 'n' from the user using scanf().
4. It initializes all elements of 'a' to 0.
5. It loops through each row of 'a' and reads a single integer from the user for each element.
6. It loops through each column of 'a' and finds the maximum value in each column.
7. It loops through each row of 'a' and checks if the maximum value in the row is also the maximum value in the column.
8. It prints "No" if no maximum value is found, otherwise it prints the maximum value in each row and column.

What are the potential problems with the code?

1. The code uses 'scanf()' to read integers from the user, but it does not check if the input is valid (e.g. if the user enters a string or a non-integer value).
2. The code uses 'break' to exit the inner loops early, but it does not check if the inner loops are actually exited.
3. The code uses 'r=1' to indicate if a maximum value was found, but it does not check if 'r' is actually set to 1 before printing the maximum value.
4. The code does not handle the case where the input array is not square (i.e. 'm' and 'n' are not equal).
5. The code does not handle the case where the input array has negative values.
