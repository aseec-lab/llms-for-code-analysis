Analyze the following piece of code: int fun(int m, int n, int j) {
	int i, s = 0;
	if (n == 1)
		return m >= j;
	for (i = j; i < m; i++)
		s = s + fun(m - i, n - 1, i);
	return s;
}
int main() {
	int n, m, s;
	int t;
	cin >> t;
	while (t--) {
		cin >> m >> n;
		if (n > m)
			n = m;
		s = fun(m, n, 0);
		cout << s << endl;
	}
	return 0;
}

Please explain in detail.

The code is a C++ program that calculates the sum of the elements in a matrix. The matrix is represented as a two-dimensional array of integers. The function fun takes three integers as input: m, n, and j, where m and n are the rows and columns of the matrix, respectively, and j is the index of the first element to be summed. The function returns the sum of all elements in the matrix that are greater than or equal to j.

The main function takes three integers as input: m, n, and t, where m and n are the rows and columns of the matrix, respectively, and t is the number of test cases. The main function first calls the function fun with the input values m, n, and 0, and stores the result in the variable s. Then, it iterates over the test cases using a while loop, and for each test case, it calls the function fun with the input values m, n, and the current value of j, where j is the index of the current element being summed. The main function then prints the value of s to the console.

The purpose of the function fun is to calculate the sum of the elements in a matrix that are greater than or equal to a given index. The function does this by recursively calling itself with the input values m, n, and the current value of i, where i is the index of the current element being summed. The function returns the sum of all elements in the matrix that are greater than or equal to the given index.

The purpose of the main function is to test the function fun with a variety of input values and print the results to the console. The main function takes three integers as input: m, n, and t, where m and n are the rows and columns of the matrix, respectively, and t is the number of test cases. The main function first calls the function fun with the input values m, n, and 0, and stores the result in the variable s. Then, it iterates over the test cases using a while loop, and for each test case, it calls the function fun with the input values m, n, and the current value of j, where j is the index of the current element being summed. The main function then prints the value of s to the console.

The purpose of the variable i in the function fun is to iterate over the elements of the matrix. The variable i is initialized to the value of j, which is the
