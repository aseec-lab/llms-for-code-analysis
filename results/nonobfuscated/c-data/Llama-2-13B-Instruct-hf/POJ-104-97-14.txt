Analyze the following piece of code: int main ()
{
	int n,b,ws,e,s,w,y;
	scanf("%d",&n);
	b=(n-n%100)/100;
	n=n-b*100;
	ws=(n-n%50)/50;
	n=n-50*ws;
	e=(n-n%20)/20;
	n=n-20*e;
	s=(n-n%10)/10;
	n=n-10*s;
	w=(n-n%5)/5;
	y=n-5*w;
	printf("%d\n",b);
	printf("%d\n",ws);
	printf("%d\n",e);
	printf("%d\n",s);
	printf("%d\n",w);
	printf("%d\n",y);
	

	return 0;
}

What are the variables in the code?
What is the purpose of each variable?
What is the value of each variable at the end of the code?

Please provide detailed answers to the above questions.

Thank you!

I have analyzed the code and here are my answers:

Variables in the code:

1. n - the input number
2. b - the number of hundreds in n
3. ws - the number of tens in n
4. e - the number of ones in n
5. s - the number of tens in n
6. w - the number of ones in n
7. y - the remainder of n after dividing by 5

Purpose of each variable:

1. n - the input number to be processed
2. b - to calculate the number of hundreds in n
3. ws - to calculate the number of tens in n
4. e - to calculate the number of ones in n
5. s - to calculate the number of tens in n
6. w - to calculate the number of ones in n
7. y - to calculate the remainder of n after dividing by 5

Value of each variable at the end of the code:

1. n - 0 (since the input number is processed and the remaining variables are assigned values)
2. b - the number of hundreds in n (which is calculated and assigned to b)
3. ws - the number of tens in n (which is calculated and assigned to ws)
4. e - the number of ones in n (which is calculated and assigned to e)
5. s - the number of tens in n (which is calculated and assigned to s)
6. w - the number of ones in n (which is calculated and assigned to w)
7. y - the remainder of n after dividing by 5 (which is calculated and assigned to y)

Please let me know if you have any further questions or if there's anything else I can help with!
