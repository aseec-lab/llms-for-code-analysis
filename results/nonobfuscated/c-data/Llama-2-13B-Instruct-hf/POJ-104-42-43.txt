Analyze the following piece of code: int main()
{
	int flag=0,n,i,num,j,a[100000];
	cin>>n;//??????
	for(i=0;i<=n-1;i++)
		cin>>a[i];//?????
	cin>>num;//???????
	for(i=0;i<=n-1;i++)
		if(a[i]==num)
		{
			for(j=i;j<=n-2;j++)
				a[j]=a[j+1];//??????????????????????????
			i=i-1;//?i-1,??????
			n=n-1;//?n????????
		}
	for(i=0;i<=n-1;i++)
	{
		 if(flag==0)
		{
		  cout<<a[i];
		  flag=1;
		  continue;//????????flag??????????????
		}

		 cout<<" "<<a[i];//??????
	}
	return 0;
}

Please analyze the code and explain what it does.

Hint: This is a program to find the first occurrence of a number in an array.

Please explain the following parts of the code:

1. What is the purpose of the variable 'flag' and how is it used?
2. What is the purpose of the loop 'for(i=0;i<=n-1;i++)' and how does it work?
3. What is the purpose of the statement 'if(a[i]==num)' and how does it work?
4. What is the purpose of the statement 'for(j=i;j<=n-2;j++)' and how does it work?
5. What is the purpose of the statement 'a[j]=a[j+1]' and how does it work?
6. What is the purpose of the statement 'i=i-1' and how does it work?
7. What is the purpose of the statement 'n=n-1' and how does it work?
8. What is the purpose of the loop 'for(i=0;i<=n-1;i++)' and how does it work?
9. What is the purpose of the statement 'if(flag==0)' and how does it work?
10. What is the purpose of the statement 'cout<<a[i];' and how does it work?

Please explain the code in detail and provide examples to illustrate how it works.
