Analyze the following piece of code: void main()
{
	char a[50][20],b[50];
	int n,i,j,c;
	scanf("%d\n",&n);
	for(i=0;i<n;i++)
		scanf("%s",a[i]);
	for(i=0;i<n;i++)
		b[i]=strlen(a[i]);
	for(i=0;i<n;i++)
	{
		c=b[i];
		if(a[i][c-1]=='g')
		{a[i][c-1]='\0';
            a[i][c-2]='\0';
			a[i][c-3]='\0';
		}
        else
		{
			a[i][c-1]='\0';
		    a[i][c-2]='\0';
		}
		printf("%s\n",a[i]);
	}
}

I'm trying to solve this problem:

Write a C program to read a string of length n from the user and replace all the 'g's with ''.

I have the basic structure of the code, but I'm having trouble with the logic inside the loops.

Please help!

Thank you!
