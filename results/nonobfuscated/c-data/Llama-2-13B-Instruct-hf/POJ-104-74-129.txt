Analyze the following piece of code: int su(int n){
	int i;
	int t=0;
	for(i=2;i<n;i++){
		if(n%i==0){
			t++;
		}
	}
	if(t==0)
		return 1;
	else
		return 0;
}
int hui(int n){
	int o=0;
	int q=0;
	q=n;
	while(1){
		o=10*o+q%10;
		q=q/10;
		if(q==0){
			break;
		}
	}
		if(n==o)
		    return 1;
		else
			return 0;
	
}
int main()
{
	int m,n,i,a[10000],k=0;
	scanf("%d%d",&m,&n);
	for(i=m;i<=n;i++){
		if(su(i)==1&&hui(i)==1){
			a[k]=i;
			k++;
		}
	}
	if(k==0){
		printf("no");
	}
	else{
		for(i=0;i<k-1;i++){
			printf("%d,",a[i]);
		}
		printf("%d",a[k-1]);
	}
	printf("\n");
	return 0;
}

What does this code do?

This code is a program to find the number of positive integers less than or equal to n which are not only prime but also palindromic.

The first function su(n) is used to check whether n is a prime number or not.

The second function hui(n) is used to check whether n is a palindromic number or not.

The main function takes two integers m and n as input and then checks all the positive integers between m and n (inclusive of both) whether they are prime and palindromic or not.

If any such number is found, it is stored in an array a[].

Finally, the program prints all the palindromic prime numbers between m and n.

Please help me understand this code.

I understand that the first function su(n) checks whether n is prime or not, and the second function hui(n) checks whether n is palindromic or not.

But I don't understand how the main function works. Specifically, I don't understand how the loop in the main function works.

Can you please explain it to me?

Also, I would like to know how the two functions su(n) and hui(n) are used in the main function.

Thank you.
