Analyze the following piece of code: int main()
{  int i,j,n,k,l,t1,t2,t3=0,t4,t5=0;
   int a[5000][2];
   scanf("%d",&n);
   for(k=0;k<n;k++)
	   for(l=0;l<2;l++)
   {scanf("%d",&a[k][l]);}
	   for(j=0;j<n-1;j++)
		for(i=0;i<n-1-j;i++)
		{   if(a[i][0]>a[i+1][0])
			{t1=a[i][0];
			a[i][0]=a[i+1][0];
			a[i+1][0]=t1;
			t2=a[i][1];
			a[i][1]=a[i+1][1];
			a[i+1][1]=t2;}
		}
  for(i=1;i<n;i++)
	{for(j=0;j<n;j++)
    {if((a[i][0]<=a[j][1])&(a[i][0]>=a[j][0])) {t5=t5;}
	else {t5=t5+1;}}
     
	
    if (t5==n-1){t3=0; 
	          printf("no"); 
	          break;}
	else{t3=1;
	t5=0;}
    }
t4=a[0][1];
if(t3!=0)
	{   for(i=0;i<n;i++)
	    { 
	      if (a[i][1]>=t4)
	      {t4=a[i][1];}
	    }
	printf("%d %d",a[0][0],t4);}
return 0;
}

This code is a sorting algorithm, specifically a variation of insertion sort. It takes an array of integers as input and sorts it in ascending order.

Here's a breakdown of the code:

1. The first line declares the main function, which takes no arguments.
2. The next line declares several variables: int i, j, n, k, l, t1, t2, t3, and t4.
3. The scanf() function is used to read an integer value from the standard input and store it in the variable n.
4. The next loop reads the values of the array a[k][l] for k=0 to n-1 and l=0 to 1.
5. The inner loop (for j=0 to n-1) sorts the subarray a[i..j] by inserting the element a[i+1][0] into its proper position.
6. The outer loop (for i=0 to n-1) checks if the element a[i][1] is greater than or equal to the current maximum value in the subarray a[0..i-1]. If it is, then the maximum value is updated and the loop continues.
7. If the maximum value is not updated, then the loop exits and the variable t5 is incremented.
8. After the outer loop finishes, the variable t5 is compared to n-1. If t5==n-1, then the array is sorted and the program prints "no" and exits. Otherwise, the program continues to the next step.
9. The inner loop (for i=0 to n-1) checks if the element a[i][1] is greater than or equal to the current maximum value in the subarray a[0..i-1]. If it is, then the maximum value is updated and the loop continues.
10. If the maximum value is not updated, then the loop exits and the program prints "yes" and exits.
11. The program then prints the sorted array using the variables a[0][0] and a[0][1].

Overall, this code is a simple sorting algorithm that is easy to understand and implement. However, it has a time complexity of O(n^2) and is not the most efficient sorting algorithm available.
