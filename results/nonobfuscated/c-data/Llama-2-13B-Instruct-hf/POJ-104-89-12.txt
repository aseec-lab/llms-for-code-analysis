Analyze the following piece of code: int n,a[10000];
void read(){
	int i,j;
	for (scanf("%d%d%d",&n,&i,&j); i+j!=0;scanf("%d%d",&i,&j)){
		a[j]++;
	}
}

	
int main(){
	int i;
	read();
	for (i=0;i<n;i++)
		if (a[i]==n-1) printf("%d\n",i);
	return 0;
}

What does this code do?

This code reads an integer n from the user, and then reads two integers i and j from the user. It then updates the value of a[j] to a[j] + 1, where a is an array of size 10000. It repeats this process until i + j is not equal to 0.

The main function reads the value of n from the user, and then calls the read function. It then loops through the array a and checks if the value of a[i] is equal to n-1. If it is, it prints the index i to the console.

The code is a simple example of a counter that counts the number of pairs of integers i and j such that i + j is not equal to 0. The array a is used to store the counts of each pair.
