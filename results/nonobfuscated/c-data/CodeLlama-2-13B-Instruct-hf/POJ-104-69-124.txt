Analyze the following piece of code: 

int main (void)
{
    int i, j, k, lena, lenb, carry, temp;
    char a[MAX_DIGITS+1], b[MAX_DIGITS+1], c[MAX_DIGITS+2];
    
    scanf ("%s", a);
    scanf ("%s", b);
    lena = strlen (a);
    lenb = strlen (b);
    carry = 0;
    k = 0;
    i = lena - 1;
    j = lenb - 1;
    while (i >= 0 && j >= 0) {
          temp = a[i] - '0' + b[j] - '0' + carry;
          c[k] = temp % 10 + '0';
          carry = temp / 10;
          i--, j--, k++;
    }
    
    if (i >= 0)
          while (i >= 0) {
                temp = a[i] - '0' + carry;
                c[k] = temp % 10 + '0';
                carry = temp / 10;
                i--, k++;
          }
    else if (j >= 0)
         while (j >= 0) {
               temp = b[j] - '0' + carry;
               c[k] = temp % 10 + '0';
               carry = temp / 10;
               j--, k++;
         }
         
    if (carry)
       c[k] = '1';
    else
        k--;
    
    while (c[k] == '0')
          k--;
    if (k < 0)
       printf ("0");
    else {
         while (k >= 0) {
               printf ("%c", c[k]);
               k--;
         }
    }
    
    return 0;
}

What is the output of this program?

Answer:

The output of this program is the sum of two numbers represented as strings.

Explanation:

The program first reads two strings, a and b, from the user. It then calculates the sum of the two numbers and stores the result in the string c. The program then prints the result.

The program uses a while loop to calculate the sum of the two numbers. The loop starts by initializing the variables i, j, k, and carry. i and j are used to iterate over the digits of a and b, respectively. k is used to iterate over the digits of c. carry is used to store the carry from the previous addition.

The loop first calculates the sum of the two digits at the current position of i and j. The result is stored in temp. The program then calculates the remainder of the sum by dividing it by 10. The remainder is stored in c[k]. The program then calculates the carry by dividing the sum by 10.

The program then updates the values of i, j, and k. If either i or j is less than 0, the program enters the else if block. The else if block calculates the sum of the remaining digits of a or b, respectively. The program then updates the values of i, j, and k.

If the carry is non-zero, the program sets c[k] to 1. Otherwise, the program sets k to k - 1.

The program then enters the while loop. The loop prints the digits of c, starting from the most significant digit. The loop stops when k is less than 0. If k is less than 0, the program prints 0.

The program then returns 0.
