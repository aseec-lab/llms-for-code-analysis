Analyze the following piece of code: #include <stdio.h>
int main () {printf("hello.\n");return(0);}

Answer:

The code is a simple C program that prints "hello." to the console and then exits with a return value of 0.

The first line is an include statement that tells the compiler to include the standard input/output library.

The second line is the main function, which is the entry point of the program.

The third line is a printf statement that prints the string "hello." to the console.

The fourth line is a return statement that returns the value 0 to the operating system.

The fifth line is the closing brace of the main function.

The sixth line is the closing brace of the program.

The code is valid and will compile and run correctly.
