Analyze the following piece of code: int main()
{
int k,n,i,j;
double x[100],*p,a,s,S;
scanf("%d",&k);
p=(double *)malloc(sizeof(double)*k);

for(i=0;i<k;i++){
scanf("%d",&n);
a=0;
s=0;
for(j=0;j<n;j++){
scanf("%lf",&x[j]);
a+=x[j]/n;}
for(j=0;j<n;j++)
s+=(x[j]-a)*(x[j]-a)/n;
S=sqrt(s);
*(p+i)=S;}
for(i=0;i<k;i++)
printf("%.5f\n",p[i]);
free(p);
return 0;
}

Answer: The code is reading in a number of values, and then calculating the standard deviation of each set of values.

The first line of the code is declaring a number of variables.

\begin{code}
int k,n,i,j;
double x[100],*p,a,s,S;
\end{code}

The first variable is an integer, and is used to store the number of sets of values that are to be read in.

The second variable is also an integer, and is used to store the number of values in each set.

The third variable is an integer, and is used as a loop counter.

The fourth variable is an integer, and is used as a loop counter.

The fifth variable is a double, and is used to store the sum of the values in each set.

The sixth variable is a double, and is used to store the sum of the squares of the values in each set.

The seventh variable is a double, and is used to store the standard deviation of each set.

The eighth variable is a double, and is used to store the standard deviation of each set.

The ninth variable is a double, and is used to store the standard deviation of each set.

The tenth variable is a double, and is used to store the standard deviation of each set.

The eleventh variable is a double, and is used to store the standard deviation of each set.

The twelfth variable is a double, and is used to store the standard deviation of each set.

The thirteenth variable is a double, and is used to store the standard deviation of each set.

The fourteenth variable is a double, and is used to store the standard deviation of each set.

The fifteenth variable is a double, and is used to store the standard deviation of each set.

The sixteenth variable is a double, and is used to store the standard deviation of each set.

The seventeenth variable is a double, and is used to store the standard deviation of each set.

The eighteenth variable is a double, and is used to store the standard deviation of each set.

The nineteenth variable is a double, and is used to store the standard deviation of each set.

The twentieth variable is a double, and is used to store the standard deviation of each set.

The twenty-first variable is a double, and is used to store the standard deviation of each set.

The twenty-second variable is a double, and is used to store the standard deviation of each set.

The twenty-third variable is a double, and is used to store the standard deviation of each set.

The twenty-fourth variable is a double, and is used to store the standard deviation of each set.

The twenty-fifth variable is a double, and is used to store the standard deviation of each set.

The twenty-sixth variable is a double, and is used to store the standard deviation of each set.

The twenty-seventh variable is a double, and is used to store the standard deviation of each set.

The twenty-eighth variable is a double, and is used to store the standard deviation of each set.

The twenty-ninth variable is a double, and is used to store the standard deviation of each set.

The thirtieth variable
