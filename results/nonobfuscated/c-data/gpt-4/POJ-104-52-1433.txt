This code takes two integers as inputs (`n` and `m`), and also takes `n` more integers as input to populate an array `a`. 

The first for loop is used to fill the array `a` from user's inputs.

The second for loop then creates a kind of cyclic redundancy in the array `a` by copying `m` elements from the beginning of the array `a` to the end of the array `a`. 

The third for loop, along with the following printf statement, prints out `n` numbers starting from the `n-m+1`th number in the updated array `a`. Thus, it's printing out the array `a` shifted `m` places to the right.

An example for better understanding:

If `n`=4 and `m`=2 and the array is [1, 2, 3, 4]. Firstly, the array is extended to [1, 2, 3, 4, 1, 2]. Then the program would print out the elements starting from the 3rd position to the 6th position, i.e., [3, 4, 1, 2]. Therefore, the array [1,2,3,4] shifted two places to the right ends up like [3,4,1,2].

Also note: This code assumes that the input array's size is less than or equals to 200, since the size of the array `a` is statically allocated as 200. If the user inputs an `n` that's greater than 200, then there will be an array out-of-bounds issue.
