This C language code compares two strings to see if they are anagrams of each other, meaning if they contain the same characters but in a different order.

Here's how it works:

The 'main' function starts by accepting two strings (array of characters) from user input. It then calculates the length of both strings. If the lengths are not the same, it directly prints "NO" and exits, because anagrams must be of the same length.

If the lengths are the same, the program then calls the 'change' function for both strings separately. 

The 'change' function takes a string (character array) as input and sorts the characters in the string in descending order. This is done using a simple bubble sort algorithm, which works by repeatedly swapping adjacent characters if they're in the wrong order. 

Back in the 'main' function, now that both strings have been sorted, it compares the characters of the strings at each index value in a loop. If it finds any different characters at the same index, it sets the variable 'k' to 1.

At the end of 'main', if 'k' is still zero (meaning no different characters were found), it prints "YES". If 'k' is 1, it prints "NO". 

In sum, the entire program effectively checks if the two input strings are anagrams of each other, printing "YES" if they are, and "NO" if they aren't.
