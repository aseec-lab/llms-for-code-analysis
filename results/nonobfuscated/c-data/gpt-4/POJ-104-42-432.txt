The given code is written in C++. It performs the following tasks:

1. Reads an integer `n` that represents the number of elements to be input next.
2. Takes `n` integer inputs from the user and stores them in the array `a[]`.
3. Reads another integer `num` from the user.
4. It then iterates over the array and if it finds the number `num` in the array, it removes that element from the array. This is done by shifting all the subsequent elements to the previous position. It then decreases the count of total numbers `n` by 1.
5. After the array is updated, it prints all the elements of the array separated by a space.
6. The `flag` variable is used to determine whether a space should be added before printing an element of the array or not. It ensures that a space doesn't appear before the first element when printing.

In simple terms, the code takes an array as an input from the user, and a number. It then removes all instances of that number from the array and prints the updated array.
