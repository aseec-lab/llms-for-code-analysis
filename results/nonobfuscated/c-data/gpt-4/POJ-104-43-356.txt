This C++ program is finding the Goldbach's partitions for an entered even number. The Goldbach's Conjecture states that every even integer greater than 2 can be represented as a sum of two prime numbers. Here, the program first checks if the entered number is even or not. If it's odd, the program gives an error message. If it's even, it finds the pairs of prime numbers that sum up to the entered number and prints them out. 

Detailed Execution :
- The program starts by reading an integer, m, from standard input.
- Then it checks if m is an odd number (m%2!=0). If it is, it prints "input error" because according to the Goldbach Conjecture, the number should be an even number greater than 2.
- If m is an even number it enters the else block where it sets n=m/2. 
- Then it enters a for loop where it starts with i=3 and t=m-i and checks all values of i <=n. For every i, if i and t are both prime (they don't have any divisors other than 1 and themselves), it prints the pair (i, t).
- To check if a number is prime, it iterates from 2 through the number and checks if the number is divisible by any of these. If it is, it breaks out of the check loop and continues to the next number. If no divisor is found, the number is prime.
- At the end, two cin.get() statements are present to make the console wait and not close immediately after execution.
