This code implements the Collatz Conjecture. It read an integer (n) from the input. It then enters a loop which continues as long as n is not equal to 1. 

In each iteration of the loop, the program outputs the current value of n. If n is odd (i.e. n%2 equals 1), it multiplies n by 3 and adds 1 (prints "*3+1=" before updating the value of n). If n is even, it divides n by 2 (prints "/2=" before updating the value of n). After each operation, it prints the new value of n. 

Finally, when n equals 1, it breaks the loop and prints "End".

In summary, for a given input number, this code prints the sequence of numbers generated by the Collatz Conjecture until reaching 1, along with the operation used at each step.
