The given C code receives an integer (t) as input which represents the number of test cases. Then, it gets t strings as input and for each string, it scans each character in the string from left to right. When it finds a character that doesn't repeat anywhere else in the string, it prints out that character and continues with the next string input. In case all the characters in the string repeat atleast once, it prints "no" to signify no such unique letter exists. 

This is done using a nested loop where the first loop goes through each character in the string, and the nested loop checks if that character recurs later in the string (ie., it is not unique). If it is not unique, num is increased by one and immediately breaks from the loop. If num is still zero after the nested loop, this indicates the current character from the outer loop is not found anywhere else in the string, thus it is printed and the loop is broken out from.

In terms of time complexity, since there are three nested loops, the worst-case scenario of the code is O(n^3) where n is the size of the string (considering strlen function is O(n) complexity).
