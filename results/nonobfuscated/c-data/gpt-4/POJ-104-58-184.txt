This program checks for valid identities in a set of input strings. In programming languages like C, an identifier is a name given to entities such as variables, functions, arrays, etc. Identifiers must follow certain rules, for example, they can be a combination of letters in lowercase (a to z) or uppercase (A to Z) or digits (0 to 9) or an underscore '_'. 

In this case, the program reads an integer input 'b' as the number of identifiers to check. It then reads each identifier string. For each string, it first checks if the first character is a letter (either uppercase or lowercase) or an underscore, which is a valid rule for identifiers.

It then reads the rest of the characters in each string and checks if each character is a letter, digit, or underscore. If a string passes these checks (all characters are valid), the program outputs '1' to signify a valid identifier. If a string fails these checks (contains invalid characters), the program outputs '0' to signify an invalid identifier. 

In other words, this program is a simple validator for programming identifiers. If the input conforms to the rules of identifiers (first character is a letter or underscore, and the rest are alphanumeric or underscore), it outputs '1'. Otherwise, it outputs '0'. 

Note: The use of the `gets` function makes this code unsafe, as it can easily cause a buffer overflow. Nowadays, this function is deprecated and the use of `fgets` or `getline` is recommended instead.
