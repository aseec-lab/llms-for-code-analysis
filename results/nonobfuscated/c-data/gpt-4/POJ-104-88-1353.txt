This C program works as follows:

1. It declares and initializes variables; `c` a string array of 50 characters, `end`, `i`, and `l` as integers.

2. It takes a string input from the user using the `gets()` function and stores it in the `c` variable. The `gets()` function allows a line of text to be entered by the user including spaces.

3. The length of the input string is calculated using the `strlen()` function and stored in `l`.

4. The `end` variable is set to 1.

5. It starts a loop that runs for the length of the string, checking each character `c[i]`.

6. Inside the loop, it checks whether each character is a numeric digit or not.

   - If the character is a numeric digit (between '0' and '9'), it will print the character out and sets the `end` variable to 0.

   - If the character is not a numeric digit and `end` is 0 (meaning that it previously found a digit in the string), it will print a newline character and set the `end` variable back to 1.

7. At the end, it returns 0 as the successful termination of the program.

In short, this code reads a string from the input, then prints each sequence of digits on a separate line. If there are multiple sequences of digits in the input, it separates them with a newline character ('\n').
