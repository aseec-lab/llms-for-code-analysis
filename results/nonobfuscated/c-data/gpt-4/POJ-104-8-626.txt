The provided code can be described as performing the following functions:

- The `read` function reads input from the user. It first reads two integers (stored in the locations pointed to by `pm` and `pn`). For the first input integer, it reads that many following integers and stores them sequentially from location `p1` onwards. For the second input integer, it reads that many following integers and stores them sequentially from location `p2` onwards.

- The `sort` function performs a selection sort on the two sequences of integers read by the `read` function. The first part of the routine sorts the integers starting from location `p1,` and the second part of the routine sorts the integers starting from location `p2`.

- The `combine` function merges the two sorted sequences of integers from locations `p1` and `p2` into one sequence, stored sequentially from the location `pnew` onwards. The length of this combined sequence is the sum of `pm` and `pn`, and this is the value returned by the function.

- The `print` function then prints out the combined and sorted integer sequence of length `k` (\*pk), with each integer separated by a space and a newline at the end.

- The `main` function initializes some variables and pointers to those variables. It then calls functions `read`, `sort`, `combine`, and `print` in that order to read user input, sort the input, combine the input, and print the sorted and combined input.
