This C code takes in three integer inputs representing a year (a), a month (b), and a day (c), and prints out the corresponding day of the week.

It first checks if the year is a leap year. If the year is evenly divisible by 4 and not by 100, or it is divisible by 400, then it sets x to 1 to indicate it's a leap year.

Then, it calculates the number of days from the beginning of the 400-year cycle to the specified year, taking into account leap years. The total number of days is then taken modulo 7 to get the day of the week (where 0 is Sunday, 1 is Monday, etc.) for December 31st of the previous year.

Subsequently, this day of the week counter is incremented by the total number of days in each month up to the month specified by the user. If February is among those months and the year is leap year, then it adds 29 days; otherwise, it adds 28 days.

Finally, the code adds the specified day of the month and, again, takes the result modulo 7. The output is the day of the week in English.
