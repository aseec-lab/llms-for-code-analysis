The C language code is for a simple console program that finds the "saddle point" in a m x n matrix. 

The two-dimensional array 'a' represents the matrix. The user inputs the arrays' values, which are denoted as matrix dimensions m and n, both representing the number of rows (m) and columns (n), respectively.

The program reads the user's two-dimensional array input a, and stores every row's maximum in array p and every column's minimum in array q. 

Afterward, it compares p and q to see if they match. If they match (implying a saddle point exists), it will print out the row and column index of the saddle point, and update variable r to 1. 

A "saddle point" in a matrix is the element which is both the largest element in its row and the smallest element in its column, or vice versa â€“ the smallest element in its row and largest in its column.

Finally, if r remains 0 (implying no saddle points were identified), it will print "No".

This program can be helpful in mathematical or scientific computations where finding such points in a matrix is required.
