The code is written in C, and is related to random number generation. 

1) `randwc(n_int32 num)` function: This function accepts an integer `num` as an argument and returns a random number between 0 and `num - 1`.

2) `abs_randwc(u32 num)` function: This function accepts an unsigned 32-bit integer `num` as an argument and returns the absolute value of a random number between 0 and `num - 1`. This means the output will always be a positive number.

3) `randnum(n_int32 lngval)` function: This function takes in a 32-bit integer `lngval`, generates a random number using a simple pseudo-random number generator algorithm, and returns it. If `lngval` is not zero, the random number generator is reseeded with the initial values of 13 and 117. The generated random number is also dependent on previously generated random numbers. This function uses a relatively simple Linear congruential generator (LCG) which is a method of generating a sequence of numbers whose properties approximate the properties of sequences of random numbers. 

Please note that these functions do not appear to use any inbuilt random number generating functions of the C language. This gives the programmer more control over the sequence of random numbers but lacks the statistical randomness of inbuilt functions.
