This C program calculates the roots of a quadratic equation. 

Here's how it works:

- The program first reads an integer `n` from the user. This integer is the number of quadratic equations that the program will attempt to solve.
- Then, for each quadratic equation, it reads three double precision floating point numbers `a`, `b`, and `c` from the user, which are the coefficients of the quadratic equation ax^2 + bx + c = 0.
- It then calculates the discriminant `d` of the equation as b^2 - 4ac.
- Based on the value of `d`, it uses the quadratic formula to compute the roots of the quadratic equation.
- If the discriminant is positive, it means the equation has two distinct real roots. The program calculates these roots, storing them in `x1` and `x2`, and then prints them.
- If the discriminant is zero, it means the equation has two identical real roots. The program calculates this root, stores it in `x1`, and then prints it twice.
- If the discriminant is negative, it means the equation has two complex roots. The program calculates the real and imaginary parts of these roots, stores them in `g` and `f` respectively, and then prints them.
- The process repeats until all `n` quadratic equations have been solved.

It should be noted that this code repeats some calculations and checks unnecessarily, and the b == 0 checks don't really affect the calculations or results, so they could be removed to simplify the code.
