This code is written in C++ and it calculates the value of 2 raised to the power of N. However, the special thing about this code is that it calculates the result without any restriction on the value of N. This happens as the result stores in the array, not in a singular variable. Therefore, it can handle very large values of N. 

Here's a breakdown of what the code does:

1. It creates an array of size 42 where all elements are initialized as 0. Also, it gets a value from the user for N.

2. It assigns the last element of the array as 1. 

3. If N is equal to 0, then it outputs 1 and ends the program.

4. Otherwise, it starts a loop which will run N times. In every iteration, it will double every element in the array, simulating a multiplication by 2. Then, it will iterate over the array again, if any element is greater than or equal to 10, the leftover will be kept and the rest will be pushed to the left side element of the array.

5. After doing these steps, we will have the binary representation of 2^N in our array. However, it is in reverse order and may contain leading zeros. 

6. So to print it correctly, it first finds out the location of the first non-zero element in the array and then prints every element from that position till the end of the array. Therefore, printing the value of 2^N.
