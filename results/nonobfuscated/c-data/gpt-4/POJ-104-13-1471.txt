The C code performs the following task:

1. It declares an integer array of size 20001 and other integer variables.
2. It reads in an integer value n from the user
3. The next line in a loop reads n number of integer inputs to the array a.
4. Then it has a nested loop to check for and remove duplicate entries in the array. If a duplicate is found, the dupe value is made zero and a counter variable num keeps track of the number of duplicates detected.
5. The third loop goes through the array again and prints out all the unique elements from the original set of numbers. The numbers are printed with a space between them, but the last number does not have a trailing whitespace.
6. Then it reads in another integer, n, from the user but this does not seem to be used further in the code.
7. The program ends by returning 0, implying successful execution.

Basically, the purpose of this code is to remove duplicate entries from a user input list of integer numbers and then print out the unique numbers.
