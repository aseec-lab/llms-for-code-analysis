This C program checks for local maximums in a 2D array, a local maximum is an element which is greater or equal to its immediate surrounding elements (top, bottom, left and right).

- First, it initializes a 2D array of size 21x21 with all elements being zero.

- Then, it takes two integers m and n as input (m, n must be smaller than 21). m is the number of rows and n is the number of columns of the array to be considered for maxima finding.

- After, it populates the array with m rows and n columns with numbers as per user's input.

- Finally, it traverses the array starting from second row up to mth row and second column up to nth column. For each element at position (i,j), it checks if the element is a local maximum, i.e., it checks if the element is greater or equal to its left, right, top and bottom neighbors. If it is, then it prints the index (i-1, j-1) of the array. Indices are decremented by 1 while printing because array in C language starts from 0, so for user convenience (assuming user's counting starts from 1), it prints (i-1, j-1) as output.

Do note, the corner elements are not compared as there may be fewer than four neighbors to compare, not conforming specific handling of border conditions in this code.
