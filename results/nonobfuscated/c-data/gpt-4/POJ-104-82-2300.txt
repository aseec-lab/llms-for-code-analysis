This C code is designed to read in a series of pairs of integer values, specified by the user. It then tests each pair to see if it meets certain conditions 

For a pair to meet the conditions:

- The first value should be between 90 and 140 (inclusive).
- The second value should be greater than 59 and up to 90 (inclusive). 

The code will then find the longest consecutive sequence of pairs that meet these conditions and output the length of this sequence. 

So, this program behaves somewhat like a counter, checking for certain conditions in successive pairs of integers and then determining the length of the longest subsequence for which these conditions are met. 

Here is a slightly broken down explanation of the code process:

- It takes an integer 'n' as input which defines the number of pairs it's going to take.
- It reads these 'n' number of pairs and stores in arrays a and b.
- It starts a loop for pressing condition which is First value should be in range of [90, 140] and the second value should be in range of (59, 90].
- If pair at i-th position meets above the condition then it assigns the value of 'i' to 'd' and checks for the consecutive values in the array which match the condition as well. 
- If any number in this set doesn't match the condition it breaks the inner loop.
- The variable 'e' at the end stores the index value at the end of the sequence.
- 'f' calculates the length of this sequence by subtracting start index from the end index and adds 1 to consider the start index as well.
- If 'f' at any point becomes greater than 'c', 'c' stores the value of 'f' making 'c' the length of the longest sequence.
- At the end, it prints the value of 'c' which is the length of the longest sequence meets the condition.
