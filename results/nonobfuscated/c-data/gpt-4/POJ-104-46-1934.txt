This program reads in a matrix (2D array) of integers and then traverses it in a clockwise spiral pattern, printing each integer it encounters on a new line. The number of rows (`m`) and columns (`n`) of the matrix are read from user input, as are the contents of the matrix.

The outer loop keeps going until it prints exactly `m*n` numbers, which is the total number of elements in the matrix. The four inner loops traverse the top-side, right-side, bottom-side and left-side of the spiral, respectively. After each lap of the spiral, the boundaries are narrowed inward by incrementing the top-left corner indices (`xxrow` and `xxcol`) and decrementing the bottom-right corner indices (`sxrow` and `sxcol`).

If at any time the total number of numbers printed (`s`) reaches `m*n`, the traversal stops.

This code at the moment, however, will not compile as the constants `M` and `N` are not defined. These would represent the max dimensions for the array `a`.
