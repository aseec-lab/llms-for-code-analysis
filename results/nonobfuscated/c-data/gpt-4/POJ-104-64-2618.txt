This C++ program is designed to compute and list, in ascending order, the Euclidean distances between pairs of points in a 3-dimensional space.

The first step of the program is to ask the user for an input `n` (the number of points). Then it reads the coordinates (x,y,z) of `n` points in 3D space. 

After storing the points, it calculates the distance between each pair of points. The formula used is the Euclidean distance formula : sqrt((x1-x2)^2 + (y1-y2)^2 + (z1-z2)^2), where (x1,y1,z1) and (x2,y2,z2) are coordinates of two different points.

The `o`, `p`, and `q` variables are used to hold the squared differences of the x, y, and z coordinates respectively, and `d` holds the distance between each pair of points.

The next part of the code is a bubble sort of these distances in ascending order.

Finally, it prints out the pairs of points in ascending order of their distances (after sorting), with the corresponding distance. If two distances are the same, the code only prints the first unique distances from the sorted list of distances.
