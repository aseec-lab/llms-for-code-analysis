This code reads two numbers as strings of digits, then adds them together as if they were normal binary integers, digit by digit from right to left, and stores the result in a third string. The result is then printed to the console. 

It starts by reading numbers into the arrays 'a' and 'b', then calculates their lengths. It proceeds to add corresponding digits from the ends of both numbers from right to left, carrying over any value over 10 to the next calculation. 

This process continues until all digits of the smaller number have been processed. If there are any remaining digits in the larger number, these are processed in the same way, with any remaining carry from the previous calculations. 

Once all digits have been processed and there's a remainder carry, this is added as the highest digit. The program then prints out the resulting sum, skipping any leading zeros. 

If the resulting sum is zero (i.e. both input numbers were zero), this would be printed to the console. 

This essentially mimics the manual process of adding two numbers from right to left, just like it is taught in primary school.
