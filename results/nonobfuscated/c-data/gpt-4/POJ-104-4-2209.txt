This C program does the following:

1. It first prompts for two user input integers `m` and `n`.
2. It then dynamically allocates a 2D array `p` of size `m` by `n` using calloc, which also initializes all elements of the array to zero.
3. Then, it prompts the user to enter `m*n` integers to populate the 2D array one by one.
4. After that, the program prints the elements of the 2D array but in an interesting way. It prints elements in diagonals of the array starting from the top-left, moving diagonally to the lower-right (not straight right-down, but diagonally down to the left).
5. The loop does this until it has printed elements in `n+m-1` diagonals.
6. In each loop, it checks for boundaries by ensuring `i` is never greater than `m` and `j` never goes below zero.

In summary: This program essentially takes a 2D array as input and then prints its elements diagonally from top-left to bottom-right. 

Note: The size of a single dimension of the array is hard-coded to be of a maximum length of 10,000 each. This might not be desirable if you want flexible sizes; also it might result in wastage of memory if the required size is smaller. The choice of this size should ideally be dependent on the specific requirements of your application.
