This code is written in the C programming language. 

It includes the standard input/output library (stdio.h) which allows the program to perform input and output operations like printing to the screen (stdout) or reading from the keyboard (stdin).

The `main()` function is the entry point for the C program. Every execution of a C program always starts with the `main()` function.

Inside the `main()` function, there is a call to `printf()` function. The `printf()` function is a library function that sends formatted output to stdout (in this case, the console). Here it's used to print the string "hello.\n" to the console. The `\n` is an escape sequence that represents a new line.

The `main()` function then returns an integer value of 0. Generally, a return value of 0 from the `main()` function signals successful completion of the program.
