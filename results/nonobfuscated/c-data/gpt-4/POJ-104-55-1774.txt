This C++ program translates a number from one base into another. Here is what each part of the code does:

1. The program initializes several character arrays and integer variables. `str[50]` is the input number, `dest[50]` is the number in the new base, and `trans[36]` holds the characters corresponding to digits in bases up to 36.

2. `trans` is filled in with the characters '0'-'9' and 'A'-'Z'.

3. The program reads three inputs from the user: `a` (the original base), `str` (the number to be converted), and `b` (the new base).

4. It interprets each character of `str` in base `a`, then uses these values to calculate `num`, the decimal value of `str`.

5. The program uses division and modulus operations to convert `num` into base `b`, storing the result in reverse order in `dest`.

6. Then, using the string length function (`strlen`), it reverses the `dest` character array to get the number in the correct order.

7. Finally, the program prints the translated number and returns 0, indicating successful execution of the program.
