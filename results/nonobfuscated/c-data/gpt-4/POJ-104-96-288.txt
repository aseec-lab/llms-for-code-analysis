This C program appears to be working on an input string from standard input, doing arithmetic operations and printing results after each operation. 

However, without a proper context, it is hard to explicitly say what this program is intended to do high level. Here's a detailed breakdown:

- It starts by declaring character arrays `a` and `q` each capable of storing up to 100 characters (plus null terminator). It also declares a few integer variables. 

- It then accepts a string from the user into array `a`. 

- If the string consists of only one character, it prints `0` and the character.

- If the string has two characters and corresponds to a number that is less than 13, it prints `0` and the original string.

- If the string is larger (more than two characters), it starts a process of calculating values based on the numbers in the string (assuming the characters are digits) and stores the results in `q` and `b`.

- After string processing, if the first character of `q` is '0', it removes this leading '0'. 

- Finally, it prints the string `q` and the last remainder from the division operation.

The use of '13' and the way handling one and two characters strings could suggest it may be handling a context-specific text to number conversion, possibly with a base 13. However, the code appears to have issues that may prevent it from functioning as expected, especially where it manipulates the `a` and `b` arrays and assuming all characters are digits.
