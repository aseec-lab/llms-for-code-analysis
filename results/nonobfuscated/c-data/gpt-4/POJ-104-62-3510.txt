This C program inputs a string of characters, removes any extra spaces between words, and prints out the resulting string.

Let's break it down:

1. The code firstly allocates two character arrays (`s` and `m`) of size 201. It initializes `m` to all zeros (which serves as an end-of-string character in C) using an array initializer.

2. Next, the user is prompted to input a string which is stored in array `s` using the `gets()` function.

3. After that, it enters a for loop that iterates through the string character by character. If the current character is not a space, or, if it is a space but is not followed by another space, the character is copied to the second string (`m`).

4. This process continues until the loop encounters the end-of-string character, denoted by '\0' in C. The purpose of this operation is to prevent appending extra spaces from the original string to the resultant string.

5. Finally, the built string stored in `m` is printed out using `puts()` function and the main function returns 0 indicating a successful execution of the program.

Therefore, this is a simple program to suppress any sequence of more than one space character between words in a string input by the user.
