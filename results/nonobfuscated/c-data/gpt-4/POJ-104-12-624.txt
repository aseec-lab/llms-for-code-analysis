This C program is designed to read a series of numbers until a 0 is entered, or until 16 numbers have been entered, then calculate and print out the number of pairs of those numbers where one number is double the other. 

If the first number entered is -1, it immediately breaks the loop and ends the program. If a sequence of 16 numbers is entered where the first number isn't -1 but then -1 is entered as one of the subsequent numbers, the loop proceeds, ignoring the -1, until the array is filled or 0 is entered.

Working of the program:
1. The outermost loop runs indefinitely until it's broken by entering -1 as the first number in a new sequence.
2. The inner 'for' loop reads numbers to the array 'a' from user input. If the user enters 0 or if 16 numbers have been entered, it breaks the loop. If the first number entered is -1, it breaks the outer loop too.
3. A nested 'for' loop then iterates across the array 'a', counting pairs of numbers where one is double the other. This count is stored in the variable 'n'.
4. The value of 'n' (which is the count of pairs where one number is double the other) is printed.
5. If the first number of the new sequence is -1, the outer loop is broken, ending the program. Otherwise, it continues to read the next sequence of numbers.
