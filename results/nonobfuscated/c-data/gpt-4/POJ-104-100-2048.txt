This C program reads in a string input from the user, organises the string in ascending order based on ASCII values, and then counts the occurrence of each alphabetical character in the string.

Here's the step-by-step analysis:
1. Declares a simple 2D array of characters `sc[100][2]` and a 1D character array `zfc[300]`.
2. The program then reads a string from the standard input using `scanf()`.
3. It sorts the characters in that string in ascending order using bubble sort, interchanging characters in the `zfc` array.
4. Next, it loops over the sorted characters. For each character, it checks if the next character is same, increments count `i` for as long as it keeps finding matching characters.
5. If the character it is currently evaluating is a letter (either uppercase or lowercase), it prints the character and the count of occurrences, then increments `x`.
6. If `x` is still 0 at the end of the loop (which means no valid alphabetic characters have been found), the program prints "No".
7. The program then exits with status code `0`.
