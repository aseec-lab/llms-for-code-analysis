This C program takes a list of integers as input that are separated by commas. It then identifies the second largest number in the list and prints it out. 

Here is a detailed operation of each part:

1) The program starts by initializing an array of 300 integers all set to 0. It has other variables `i`, `j`, `n`, `max2`, and `t` all are integers and `c` of character type.

2) Then it goes into a while loop reading in integers using `scanf`. After reading each integer, it increments `i`, `n`, and then reads a character which is expected to be a comma.

3) It keeps repeating these steps until it encounters a character that is not a comma, or the number of integers read reaches 300. The variable `n` keeps track of the number of integers read.

4) If only one integer is read, which implies that there is no comma after the first integer, the program will print out "No" and end.

5) If more than one integer is read, the program goes into a nested loop (essentially a bubble sort algorithm) to sort the integers in decreasing order.

6) After sorting, if the last integer (smallest as per decreasing order) is equal to the first integer (largest), which implies all integers are the same, it prints out "No".

7) If all integers are not the same, the program goes through the sorted list from the start until it finds the first integer that is not equal to the biggest integer (`a[0]`). This integer will be the second largest.

8) The second largest number is then printed out.

It should be noted that the program has an error in situations where all numbers are the same. In such cases, it will print out "No" instead of the duplicated number.

So, this code can find the second-largest number in a list of distinct numbers. In a list of identical numbers, it will not give accurate output.
