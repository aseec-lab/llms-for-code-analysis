This is a C program that appears to calculate the area of a general (non-right) quadrilateral, given the lengths of its sides and one of its angles. Here's a breakdown of what it does:

In the main function, it first declares a function prototype for mian(). It then declares several double variables. It uses scanf() function to take five user inputs and stores them in variables a, b, c, d, and j. The variables a, b, c and d represent the sides of the quadrilateral and j is one of its angles.

After that, it calls mian() function with the inputs a, b, c, d, j as arguments and assigns the returned value to the variable s. If the value of s is equal to 0, it prints "Invalid input", else it prints the value of s rounded to four decimal places. 

The mian() function calculates the area of the quadrilateral using the Brahmagupta's formula which is a formula for the area of a cyclic quadrilateral given the lengths of the sides.
First, it converts the angle j from degrees to radians and assigns the value to variable q. Then, it calculates the semi-perimeter of the quadrilateral and assigns it to variable s. Variable w is used to compute a portion of the main formula mentioned. If the value of w is negative, the function returns 0, else it returns the square root of w which is the area of the quadrilateral. The condition w<0 exists as a safety check since taking the square root of a negative number would be invalid.
