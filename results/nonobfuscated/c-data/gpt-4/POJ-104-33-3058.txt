This code is a simple C++ program that reads an integer (n) and applies a series of operations to n lines of input. The input lines are expected to be strings of characters that are expected to contain a mix of the letters 'A', 'T', 'G', and 'C'. 

For each string, it replaces every 'A' with 'T', 'T' with 'A', 'G' with 'C', 'C' with 'G', to create a new string. If the input character is not 'A', 'T', 'G', or 'C' then the behavior is undefined and will likely lead to errors. 

After each new string is created, it is immediately printed to the standard output. 

These operations are repeated n times, where n is the integer initially read from the standard input.

This algorithm is commonly known as the DNA complementing process, where 'A' pairs with 'T' and 'G' pairs with 'C' and vice versa. 

Some points to note about the code:

1. The code uses the 'gets' function to read strings, which has been removed from latest C++ standards due to its vulnerability to buffer overrun errors. It is recommended to use fgets, or better yet, std::getline in C++. 

2. The code assumes that the string ends with a null character ('\0'). If it does not, this could lead to an off-by-one error narrowing the last set character in z2 with '\0'. 

3. All other possible characters from the input string are not handled, which could lead to unpredictable results. Use of a 'default' case to handle unexpected input would be a more robust solution.
