This code uses the C programming language. It's essentially a character frequency counter that also records where those characters were found.

It begins by defining a structure with two elements: `num` (an integer) and `w` (a character array of size 26). This structure is then used to create two arrays: `book` of size 999 and `test` of size 1.

In the `main` function, first it asks for `m` number of books to be input. For each of these books, it asks for a number associated with the book (assigning it to `book[i].num`) as well as a string of characters, assumedly its title (assigning it to `book[i].w`).

Next, it begins counting occurrences of each character from 'A' to 'Z' in every single string of `book[i].w`, effectively counting the frequency of each character in all book names entered. The character with the highest frequency (number of occurrences `n`), and its corresponding character (`c`), are stored as well.

If two or more characters have the same highest frequency `n`, the character that comes first when moving from A to Z will be recorded.

Finally, it prints out the character `c` with the highest frequency and its frequency `n`, as well as the `num` of the books which contain this character.

This program may have problems if the string inputted has lower case letters or any non-alphabetical characters because the code does not handle cases other than capital 'A' to 'Z'.

The `test[1]` struct seems unused within the code you've provided, so it's unclear what its purpose would be in a broader context.
