The C++ code reads an integer from standard input then performs some operation in a loop from 1 up to that input number, finally outputting the result. Here is breakdown:

1. The program first reads an integer "n" from the input.
2. Then, it starts a loop from 1 to "n" inclusive.
3. In each iteration, it calculates the remainder when "i" is divided by 7, this is stored in variable "a".
4. The last digit of "i" is stored in variable "b".
5. The number "i" without its last digit is stored in variable "c".
6. If "i" is not a multiple of 7, and neither the last digit nor the number derived from "i" by removing the last digit equals 7, then the sum "s" is increased by the square of "i".
7. After the loop ends, the program outputs the sum "s".
   
The purpose of the code is calculating the sum of the squares of numbers from 1 to "n" (inclusive), avoiding numbers that are multiple of 7, or have 7 as their last digit or the number formed by removing the last digit is 7. The result is then printed out.
