This is a C program which reads a string from the standard input (normally the keyboard) and reverses the order of the words in the string. 

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of how the program works: 

1. The `main()` function is the entry point of the program.

2. The pointer variables `p`, `head`, and `q` are declared (however, `head` and `q` are not used in the program), and int variables `i`, `j`, `n` are initialized. 

3. Memory is allocated for variable `p` to store up to 100 characters, and a string is then read from the standard input using the `gets()` function. 

4. The length of string `p` is determined using the `strlen()` function and stored in `n`. 

5. The program then goes into a loop, iterating from the end of the string to the beginning, checking if each character is a space. 

6. If the character at position `i` in the string is a space, another loop prints the characters that follow until either another space or the end of the string is encountered. This effectively prints a word in the original string.

7. Once a word is printed, it prints a space before moving to the next word. 

8. After the loop completes, the program prints the first word in the string (because it hasn't yet been printed). 

In sum, this program takes a user-inputted string, and it prints out the words in reverse order.
