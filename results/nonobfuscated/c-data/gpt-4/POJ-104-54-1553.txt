The given C++ code gets two integer inputs from the user, n and k. It then proceeds to perform calculations within a nested loop and finally outputs the value of 'a[1]' when it is not equal to zero.

This program is designed to solve problems of a specific mathematical model. n could be interpreted as the total number of subjects and k as a fixed constant.

After taking the inputs, it initializes an array a[1001] and set all elements as 0. And then it enters a forever loop where it calculates the values for the array a in reverse (from n to 1).

In the outer loop (for i loop), it keeps incrementing the index 'i' and in the inner loop (for j loop), it calculates the value for a[j] while going down from n-1 to 1. The value of a[j] is calculated based on the value in the next index and the input 'k'. This process continues until a[1] becomes non-zero. As soon as a[1] is not zero, it prints out the value and breaks out of the loop.

The code doesn't seem to have a specific meaningful application in common programming scenarios but seems suitable in mathematical computation and problem-solving domains. In mathematics, this can be used to generate a sequence based on the prescribed model in the code.

Also, this code assumes both n and k are positive integers and n is less than 1001. Not satisfying these constraints can lead to unexpected behaviour. 

In addition, there is no condition to break the infinite loop which means if there is no possible 'i' for which a[1] is not zero, then the program will run into an infinite loop.
