This C program takes an integer `n` and a string `a` as input, then it produces substrings of length `n` from `a` and stores each one separately in an array `b`. Each substring is kept track of their occurrence in the string `a` with the help of integer array `num`. After counting occurrences, the program sorts the array of strings (`b`) with bubble sort based on number of occurrences.

At the end, it checks the count of occurrences for the most frequent substring. If there's no repetition, it prints 'NO'. But, if there is, it prints the maximum count of occurrences and the corresponding substring/substrings. Within the array, those substrings that are equal in maximum occurrences are treated as having the same frequency and hence, all are printed.
