This C program does the following:

- The function `read()` takes as input a sequence of integers. The first integer read is assigned to `n`, and then a pair of integers is read where `i` represents a value and `j` is an index. The condition for the input's termination is a pair `i`,`j` such that `i`+`j` is equal to zero.
For each pair of numbers read (`i`,`j`), it increases the value of the jth element of the array `a` by 1.

- In the main function, it calls `read()` function first to get the input and populate the array `a`.
Then it loops through each element of the array `a` from 0 to `n-1`, if the value of an element is `n-1`, it's index is printed out.

In a nutshell, it seems like this program is trying to find elements in an array that have been incremented `n-1` times, based on the pairs of numbers given as input (ignoring the first value in the pair).
So, it could be used to find out which indices in `a` are repeated `n-1` times in the pairs of numbers read from the input. The value of n could be not only the total of pairs but also a value to be checked against, it really depends on the context where this code is being used.
