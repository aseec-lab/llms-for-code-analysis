This C code primarily does the following tasks:

1. It takes an integer `N` as an input from the user which signifies the dimension of a square matrix.

2. Then, it dynamically allocates memory for a two-dimensional array (or matrix) of size `N x N` using `malloc`.

3. It fills up this 2D array with integers entered by the user.

4. As it populates the 2D array, it also checks for the smallest rectangle that can be formed with 0s as the corners in the 2D array. The `a` and `b` variables keep record of the top left corner of the rectangle and the `c` and `d` variables keep track of the bottom right corner of the rectangle.

5. At the end, the program prints the area of this rectangular area, excluding the boundary (that's why there is `-1` for both dimensions). If no such rectangular area with zeroes on corners can be found, it would print `0`.
