This C code contains two functions: `f` and `main`,
  
1. int `f` function: 

   This function takes an integer `n` and returns a new integer formed by reversing the digits of the given integer `n`. The sign of the integer (`negative`, `zero`, or `positive`) is preserved in the reversed integer.

2. `main` function: 

   This function requests a user to input 6 different integers. For each integer, the function calls `f` and the reversed number is printed out to the console.

Let's say if a user provides input `123, -456, 789, -101, 0, 999`, the output would be `321, -654, 987, -101, 0, 999`.
