This program does the following:

1. It defines a 5x5 two-dimensional array named 'juzhen'.

2. It then takes 25 integers (one for each cell in the array) as input from the user, storing them in the 'juzhen' array.

3. After that, it reads two more integers (m and n) from the user.

4. If m and n are valid indices (between 0 and 4, inclusive), it swaps the mth and nth rows in the 'juzhen' array. 

5. It then prints the 'juzhen' array, one row per line, with each element in the row separated by a space. The last number in each row is not followed by a space.

6. If m or n are outside the range of valid indices, it prints "error".

7. The program finally concludes and returns 0.

This program essentially performs a row swap of a 5x5 matrix according to user input. It swaps row m with row n.
