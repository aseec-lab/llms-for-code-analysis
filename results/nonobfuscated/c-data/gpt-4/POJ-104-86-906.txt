This is a simple console-based C++ application that accepts a series of integer inputs and conducts some calculations based on the inputs provided. Here's what it does:

1. It reads an integer number `n` from the input.

2. Declares an array of integers `a` with a size of 100.

3. Runs a loop `n` times. In each iteration of the loop, it does the following operations:

   - Reads another integer `m` from input.
  
   - Checks if `m` is equal to zero. If it is, prints "60" and skips to the next iteration of the loop. 

   - If `m` isn't zero, it:

     - Reads `m` numbers from the input and stores them in the array.

     - Runs another loop `m` times and does the following:

       - If the `j`-th element of the array is less than 59, adds 3 to `sum`.

       - If `a[j] + sum` exceeds 63, subtracts 3 from `sum` and prints `60 - sum`, then breaks the loop.

       - If `a[j] + sum` is more than 60, prints `a[j]` and breaks the loop.
       
       - If `j` equals `m - 1` (which essentially means it's the last element of the array), prints `60 - sum`.

The overall function of this code isn't clear without proper context, but it seems to be performing some kind of time calculation, possibly determining remaining time intervals in some kind of schedule, based on the printing of "60 - sum" (which could be interpreted as the remaining time available in every hour) and the uses of 60 and 3 as key compare/modify values. It takes specific actions depending on whether certain threshold values (59, 60 and 63) are surpassed. The specific interpretation would however depend on the input and the practical context.
