The code reads in `n` number of students from standard input and calculates scholarship amounts for each student based on their qualifications. The following qualifications are considered:

1. Student score `qim` greater than 80 and at least 1 `lunw` can earn a scholarship of 8000.
2. Student score `qim` greater than 85 and `piny` greater than 80 can earn a scholarship of 4000. 
3. Student score `qim` greater than 90 can earn a scholarship of 2000.
4. Student score `qim` greater than 85 and `xib` equals 'Y' can earn a scholarship of 1000.
5. Student score `piny` greater than 80 and `ganb` equals 'Y' can earn a scholarship of 850.

As the scholarships are being calculated, the program keeps track of the student with the highest total scholarship amount.

The identified structure `student` has the following fields:
`name`: Student's name 
`qim`, `piny`, `lunw`: Scores or other numerical attributes of the student 
`ganb`, `xib`: Character attributes of the student 
`sum`: Total scholarship amount for the student

After all the scholarships are calculated, the program prints the name and the maximum scholarship of the student who gets the highest scholarship, and the sum of all scholarships.

The code dynamically allocates memory for `n` number of students using `malloc()`.
