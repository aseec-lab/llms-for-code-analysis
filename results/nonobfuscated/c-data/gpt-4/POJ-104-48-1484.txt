The given C program seems to simulate a two-dimensional cellular automaton. The top and bottom rows and the left and right columns are ignored.

The main part of the code is the nested loop section where each cell in the 9x9 center grid is taken and its new state is calculated based on its own state and the states of its eight neighbors in the previous simulation step.
This new state is; two times of its own previous state plus sum of the previous state of its eight neighbours.

Initially, the state of every cell is 0 except cell at (5,5) position which is set to m where m is an input given by the user.

This simulation step is run for n steps where n is another input given by the user.

Apart from this, there are sections where the initial state of each cell is set to 0 and a section where the final state of the automaton after n steps is printed to the console. 

Also, note that the array a[11][11][6] clearly restricts the number of iterations n to be less than or equal to 5. If n is greater than 5, the program may result in unexpected behavior or crash due to an array index out of bound error.
