This C program is meant to calculate a student's Grade Point Average (GPA) based on a set of class credits and corresponding grades. 

Here is a step by step breakdown:

1. The number of courses (`n`) the student has taken is read from the user.

2. Then, the credits for each course (`a[i]`) are read user input.

3. The grades (`b[i]`) for each course are also read. The grades are then converted to GPA points (`c[i]`) based on the provided grading scale.

4. Finally, the weighted GPA is calculated according to the formula GPA = sum(credit[i] * GPA[i]) / sum(credit[i]), and printed out to 2 decimal places.

This program assumes the user will input integer grades between 0-100 and also assumes a specific grading scale.

For example, a grade between 90 and 100 corresponds to GPA of 4.0, a grade between 85 and 89 corresponds to a GPA of 3.7, etc.
