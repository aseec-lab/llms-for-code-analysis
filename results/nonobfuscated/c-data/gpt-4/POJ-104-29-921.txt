This code calculates the sum of the first 'n' terms of a particular sequence. The sequence is a variant of the Fibonacci sequence, where each number is the ratio of two consecutive Fibonacci numbers, i.e., 2/1, 3/2, 5/3, .. and so on. 

Here is a step by step description:

1. Declares an array of double `a` and int `d` to store these sequence values and the number of terms to be summed up and other related variables.
2. First initializes an array `a` with the first value of sequence, 2/1, and then reads 'n' integer values from user input.
3. Then, for each read integer, it calculates the first 'n' terms of the sequence, stores it in `a` and adds them together.
4. It uses Fibonacci sequence logic to calculate next number in the sequence. It starts with 2 and 1, then in each step it switches the two numbers and adds the new two numbers to become the next number.
5. Finally it prints the calculated sum up to 3 decimal places and loops back to the next integer read at step 2. 

This is done until all inputted integers have been processed and the corresponding sums have printed. It will print each sum on a new line. The return value is 0 which signifies that the program has run without errors.
