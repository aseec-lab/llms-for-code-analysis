This C program accepts two numbers m and n as inputs from the user, and does the following:

1. The first function named `su()` checks if a number is prime or not. This is done by checking if the number is divisible by any number other than 1 and itself. If it doesn't have any divisor other than 1 and itself, it's a prime number.

2. The second function named `hui()` checks if a number is a palindrome or not. A number is said to be a palindrome if it is the same from forward and backward. This is done by reversing the number and comparing it with the original number.

3. The main body of the program checks every number between the input number m and n (both inclusive). For every number i between m and n, it checks if the number is both prime (using `su(i) == 1`) and a palindrome (using `hui(i) == 1`). If it is both, it stores the number in an array `a[]` and then increments the index k by one.

4. After checking all numbers from m to n, if no prime palindrome numbers are found (`k == 0`), it prints "no". If any prime palindrome numbers are found, it prints all such numbers, separating each two numbers by a comma.

So, overall this C program takes two numbers and finds out all the prime palindrome numbers between those two numbers (both inclusive).
