This program takes in an integer 'n' and reverses its digits. 

It initially breaks down 'n' into individual digits 'a', 'b', 'c', 'd' where 'a' is the thousandths place, 'b' is the hundredth place, 'c' is the tenth place, and 'd' is the units place.

It then checks from the most significant digit ('a') and prints the digits in reverse order if the digit is not zero. If 'a' is zero, it does not print it and checks for the next digit 'b'. If 'b' is zero, it continues to the next digit 'c'. If 'c' is also zero, it now prints only the last digit 'd'. 

This process eliminates leading zeroes in the original number for the reversed output. 

For example, if input n = 123, output would be 321. If n =1000, output would be 1, effectively removing leading zeros.
