This C code reads two integers n and k from stdin, and then reads n more integers into an array. 

The code goes through every pair of distinct elements in the array, and if the subtraction of one element from k equals to the other element, it prints "yes" to stdout and ends. If no such pair is found in the array after checking all of the elements, it will print "no." Essentially, it checks if there are two numbers in the list where one number is equal to (k - the other number). 

Please note that there is an issue with this code: it checks pairs twice because of the nested loop structure, but that doesn't affect the overall functionality.
