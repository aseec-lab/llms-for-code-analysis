The code is written in C++. It appears to calculate Fibonacci numbers for a set of integers provided as input.

To break it down:

- The user is prompted to input a number `n`. This will serve as the size of the arrays `a` and `b`.

- An array `a` is created of length `n`, and the user is prompted to enter `n` numbers, which are stored in this array.

- The loop then iterates through `j` from 0 to `n`. 

    - Within this loop, variables `p` and `q` are initialized to 0 and 1.

    - A second loop runs `b[j]` times, with `b[j]` being set to each integer from 0 to `a[j]-1`. For each iteration,
        - The current `p` value is stored in `r`.
        - The `p` is updated to hold the current value of `q`.
        - `q` is updated with the sum of `q` and `r` (which holds the previous `p` value).

    - This second loop essentially calculates Fibonacci numbers `a[j]` times with `q` always holding the next Fibonacci number.

- At the end of each `j` iteration, `q` should hold the `a[j]`-th Fibonacci number (if we consider the first two Fibonacci numbers to be 0 and 1, and `a[j]` to be 1-indexed).

So, in summary, the code receives `n` numbers from the user and then prints the `a[j]`-th Fibonacci number for each received number. 

However there seems to be a bug: it actually calculates first `a[j]-1` Fibonacci numbers which is probably not intended behavior. It can be fixed by substitifying `a[j]-1` with `a[j]` in the inner loop condition.

This code might not work correctly for negative numbers or too large numbers given that it doesn't have any range checks and it could overflow int datatype for large `a[j]`.
