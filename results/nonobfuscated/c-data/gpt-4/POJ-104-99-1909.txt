This is a C program that analyzes the age distribution in a given sample size. Here are the steps:

1. It takes a number (n) as input. From context, this appears to be the size of the sample, i.e., the number of ages that will be entered.

2. The ages are entered one by one, stored in an array (e).

3. The ages are iterated over with a for loop. Depending on the age;

   - If the age is less than or equal to 18, it increments the variable (a).
   - If the age is more than 18 but less than or equal to 35, it increments the variable (b).
   - If the age is more than 35 but less than or equal to 60, it increments the variable (c).
   - If the age is above 60, it increments the variable (d).

4. Once all the ages have been processed, the program divides each count (a, b, c, and d) by the total number of ages entered (n). This average is then multiplied by 100 to get a percentage value for each age group.

5. Finally, it prints the percentage of people in each age group:

   - 1-18
   - 19-35
   - 36-60
   - Above 60

Please note that if you enter a non-integer value for 'n', the loops will not function as expected since 'n' is used as the limit in integer based for loops. 'n' should be an integer number.
