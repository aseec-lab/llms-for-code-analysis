This code is used to create a linked list for storing student information and display the saved information.

The structure 'student' is used to store individual student's data such as `num`, `name`, `sex`, `old`, `score`, and `add`. The `next` pointer is used to link each student structure to form a linked list.

In the main function, firstly, memory is allocated dynamically for the `p1` pointer to store student data. The user is then prompted to input student's `num` (presumably standing for student id or number). If the entered `num` is not "end", the program will ask the user for the other data fields (`name`, `sex`, `age`, `score`, and `add`). 

This process continues until the user inputs "end" as the student number. Each new student is always added to the beginning of the list, so the latest entered student will be first.

After the data has been entered, the program begins to print out the stored student data, starting from the first student entered (the latest added to the beginning of the list) down to the last student entered.

This pattern of data entry and printing is typical of a last-in-first-out (LIFO) structure also known as a stack.
