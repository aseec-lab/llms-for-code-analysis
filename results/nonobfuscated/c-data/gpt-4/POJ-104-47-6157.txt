This C++ program inputs an array of n integers, reverses the order of the array, and then prints the reversed array.

When the program runs:
1. It first takes an integer input n from the user.
2. Then it takes n integers as input from the user and stores them into array a.
3. The next loop swaps the array elements, reversing their order. It starts from the first and last element and moves inwards. Each swap involves storing the element at position i in temporary variable t, replacing the element at position i with the element at position j, and replacing the position j with the original element from position i (stored in t).
4. Finally, the program prints all the elements of the reverse ordered array with a for loop. The final element is printed separately after the loop to avoid printing an additional white space after the final number.
5. The main function then returns 0, indicating successful execution of the program.

Note: This program assumes any input number n will be less than or equal to 100000 and doesn't perform any error or bounds checking on the inputs.
