This code is a program in C that calculates the number of certain denomination bills you would receive given some amount of money. The program  takes a single input, an integer `n`, that represents the amount of money. Then, the program calculates how many 100, 50, 20, 10, 5, and 1 denomination bills one would get if the given amount was to be broken down into these bills from the highest denomination to the lowest. 

Here's a detailed breakdown:

1. The variable `n` is the amount of money.
2. The variable `b` stores the number of 100 denomination bills to be gotten.
3. `n` is updated to store the remaining amount of money after taking out 100 denomination bills.
4. The variable `ws` stores the number of 50 denomination bills from the remaining amount.
5. `n` is updated to store the remaining amount of money after taking out 50 denomination bills.
6. Similarly, this process continues for denominations 20 (`e`), 10 (`s`), 5 (`w`) and finally the remaining singles are stored in `y`.
7. Then it prints the number of each denomination to the console.

Note: This calculation assumes that you would always want to maximize the count of highest denomination bill, and this is repeated for each denomination down from 100 to 1. It also assumes that the inputted money amount `n` is in the same unit as the denominator of the bills (dollars, for example).
