The provided code is written in C++ and it implements the Bubble Sort algorithm to sort an array of integers in descending order. 

Here's what each line or code block does:

1. `int i=0,j=0,p=0,a[101],n=0;`: Declares and initializes variables i, j, p, and n as integers with 0. It also declares an array a of size 101 as integer.

2. `memset(a,0,sizeof(a));`: This line initializes all the elements of array a with 0.

3. `cin>>n;`: It asks for an input from the user to define the size of the array to be sorted (that size should not exceed 100).

4. `for(i=1;i<=n;i++) cin>>a[i];`: This loop takes 'n' elements input from user to fill in the array.

5. The nest loop that follows is the Bubble Sort algorithm. It repeatedly swaps the adjacent elements if they are in wrong order. The comparison is done in such a way that the ith entry of the array is less than the (i+1)th entry. If true, then these two entries are swapped. 

6. `cout<<a[1]<<endl; cout<<a[2];`: Finally, it prints out the first and the second largest numbers in the sorted array (since the array is sorted in descending order).

7. `return 0;` returns 0 to indicate that the program has run successfully.

Note: The index of the array starts from 1 here, not 0 which is typically used in C++.
