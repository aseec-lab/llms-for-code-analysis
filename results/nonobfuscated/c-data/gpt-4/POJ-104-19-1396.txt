This C program does the following:

1. It reads a line of text from the user and splits it into words, storing those words in a 2D character array (effectively a list of strings).

2. It then reads another two lines, each expected to be a single word.

3. The program then checks if the first of these words (`a`) appears in the list of words extracted from the initial line of text. If it does, the program replaces that word with the second word (`b`) in the list.

4. Finally, the program outputs the potentially modified list of words, all on the same line, with a space between each word.

Please note, this program uses `gets` function which is known as a dangerous function and should be replaced by `fgets`, because it can cause buffer overflow and lead to security issues. It also lacks error checking, it doesn't check if user entered words correctly or not. There are also no limits on how many words you can enter in the first line of text, which might cause issues if there are more than 50 words.
