The code is a C++ program that checks a string of parentheses and identifies their matching status. 

This program reads strings in a loop from the standard input (`cin`) until the end of input is reached.

In the process, it creates two arrays - `ch` of characters and `note` of integers, both of the same size. The `ch` array stores the current string where each character is a parenthesis and `note` array is used to keep track of the matching status of each parenthesis in the string.

The program iterates over each character in the string. If it's an opening parenthesis '(', it checks if there's a matching closing parenthesis ')'. If it finds the match, it sets the value in `note` corresponding to the position of this parenthesis to `0`. Otherwise, it sets the value in `note` at the corresponding position to `1`.

Similarly, if the current character is a closing parenthesis ')', it checks if there's a matching opening parenthesis '('. If it finds the match, it sets the value in `note` corresponding to the position of this parenthesis to `0`. Otherwise, it sets the value in `note` at the corresponding position to `-1`.

For all other characters, it just skips to the next character.

Then, it prints the original parentheses string `ch`, and on the next line, it prints a line of symbols reflecting the matching status of each parenthesis. For each element at the `note` array: it prints a '$' if the value is `1` (indicating unmatched opening parenthesis), a '?' if it's `-1` (indicating unmatched closing parenthesis), or a blank space if it's `0` (indicating a matched pair of parentheses).

The program continues this until there's no more input. The purpose of such a program might be for parsing and syntax analysis, debugging, or assisting with balancing parentheses in a text editor.
