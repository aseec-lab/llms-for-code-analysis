This C program does the following:

1. It starts by taking an input 'n' from the user which specifies the size of an array 'a'.

2. It then creates an array of integers 'a' of size 'n' and another array 'b' of size 100.

3. It takes 'n' numbers as input from the user and stores them in the array 'a'.

4. It then runs a loop to traverse the array 'a' and checks for odd numbers. For every odd number it encounters, it increments a counter 'd' which counts the number of odd numbers in the array.

5. The program then copies the odd numbers from array 'a' to array 'b' and 'c' holds the index of the last encountered odd number in array 'a'.

6. It then sorts the odd numbers stored in the array 'b' in ascending order using the Bubble sort algorithm.

7. Finally, it prints the sorted odd numbers to the console, each number separated by a comma except for the last odd number. The last odd number is printed without the trailing comma.

8. Lastly, the program waits for an additional integer input from the user, but it does not use this input in any way.

This program does not have any error checking. If you enter more numbers than you specified for 'n' or if you don't enter any odd numbers, it could give incorrect or unexpected output.
