This C program performs the following steps:

1. Reads an integer value `k` from standard input, which represents the number of data sets the user will input.
2. Allocates memory to hold `k` double values.
3. For each data set (`k`):
    - Reads an integer `n` which indicates the number of elements in the current data set.
    - For each element in the data set:
        - Reads the element (real number), calculated its contribution to the arithmetic average and adds it to a running sum.`a` is the calculated arithmetic average of the current data set of `n` elements.
    - For each element in the data set, it calculates the squared deviation from the mean `a`.
    - It then takes the square root of the average squared deviation to get the standard deviation `S`. This standard deviation is stored in the memory block pointed to by `p`.
4. After all `k` data sets have been processed, the program prints each calculated standard deviation, each on a new line and to five decimal places.
5. Finally, the program frees the block of memory it had allocated for the standard deviations.

Essentially, this is a simple C program that calculates and prints the standard deviation of `k` different data sets. Each set could have a different number of real numbers.
