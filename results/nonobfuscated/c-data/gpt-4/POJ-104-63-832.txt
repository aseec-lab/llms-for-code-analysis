This code performs matrix multiplication.

It starts by declaring variables for the sizes of two matrices (x1,y1) and (x2,y2), as well as loop variables (i,j,k). It also declares three 2D arrays a, b and c for both input matrices and the result matrix.

The user is then prompted to input the size of the first matrix (x1,y1) and then the elements of this matrix. This process is repeated for the second matrix with dimensions (x2,y2).

The program then performs the multiplication of the two matrices. For each corresponding pair of cells in the result matrix c, it computes the dot product of the corresponding row from the first matrix and the corresponding column from the second matrix.

After the multiplication, the program prints out the result matrix c. Note that this operation is only valid if the number of columns in the first matrix (y1) equals the number of rows in the second matrix (x2). The output is printed row by row with a space between each element and a newline at the end of each row. 

Finally, the program returns 0 to indicate successful termination.
