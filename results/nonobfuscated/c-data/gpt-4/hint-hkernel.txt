This code is complex and without specific information about the data types and structures it's utilizing, such as DSIZE, ISIZE, RECT, and ERROR, it's difficult to provide an exact determination of what the function does. Nonetheless, this function appears to be performing some sort of calculations on an array of "rect" structures and various other variables.

To begin with, it initializes some fields in the "rect" structure, and then proceeds to loop through, dividing the existing rectangles into two smaller rectangles and computing some values based on the dimensions of the (smaller) rectangles.

The dividing and calculation process involves some operations with the given parameters, including possible error computations, as indicated by the "errs" array and "errio" and "errjo".

In the end, an "eflag" variable is set based on whether the loop has executed as many times as defined by "*mcnt".

The function returns a value derived from the differences between the 'sh' and 'sl' â€“ these appear to evolve through the loop depending on the division and calculation carried out on each rectangle.

However, the specific purpose and context of the function are hard to deduce from the code alone without additional context.
