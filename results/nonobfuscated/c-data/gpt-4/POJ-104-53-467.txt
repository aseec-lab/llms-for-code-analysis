This code primarily performs the function of reading in a series of integers and then only outputting distinct (non-duplicate) integers in the original order they were entered.

Here is a walkthrough of the code:

1. It first takes an input `n` which specifies the number of integers to be entered.

2. It then reads `n` integers to an integer array `a`. Indices of this array range from 0 to `n-1`.

3. A loop scans through the array. If it encounters an integer in array index `i-1` that is not zero, it scans the rest of the array to find if there are entries which are the same. If found, those entries are set to zero. This step essentially removes the duplicates from array.

4. The final loop iterates over the array to print each non-zero element in the array. The variable `b` is used to ensure the correct formatting of the output (by not putting a comma before the first value).

In summary, the code removes duplicates from an array of entered integers and then prints the distinct numbers in the order they were entered.
