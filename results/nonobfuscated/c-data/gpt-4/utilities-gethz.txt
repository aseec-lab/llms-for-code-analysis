The provided C code prints out the number of clock ticks per second for your system.

In detail:

- The libraries `unistd.h` and `stdio.h` are included at the beginning. `unistd.h` is the header file that provides access to the POSIX operating system API, and `stdio.h` is the header file that provides functionalities for input and output.
 
- The program's entry point is the `main` function. Inside this function, `printf` is used to print out the value returned by the function `sysconf(_SC_CLK_TCK)`.
   
- The `sysconf` function provides a way to access system configuration information at runtime. Specifically, `_SC_CLK_TCK` gives the number of clock ticks per second. 

So, the overall function of this code is to output the number of clock ticks per second for your specific system.
