This code calculates the date in a certain year by a given number of days, considering leap years as well.

Let me break it down for you:

1. The user inputs three numbers `a`, `b`, `c`.

2. `a` is interpreted as the year, `b` as the month and `c` as the day. These values originate from the start of the year.

3. An array `d` is initiated containing number of days for each month in a non-leap year.

4. The code then checks if `a` falls into a leap year by checking if the year is evenly divisible by 4 but not by 100, or is evenly divisible by 400. If `a` satisfies either of these conditions, then it is a leap year and one day (29th February) is added to February in the `d` array (`d[1]`).

5. Then, an integer `g` is initiated, storing the number of the day (`c`).

6. For each month up to `b`-1 (because array starts from 0), the days of the month are added to `g`.

7. Finally, the total number of days (`g`) from the start of the year to the end of month `b` is printed out.

There seems to be a logic flaw in the code snippet `while(i>=b) { d[i]++; }` as `i` is initialized as 0 and thus the loop will not run if `b` is >0.

Without an additional context, it would seem that this part of the code could be removed, as it appears to have no direct influence on the code outcome. Perhaps, it's a mistakenly left debugging or testing snippet.
