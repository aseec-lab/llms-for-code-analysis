This C code reads a series of 2D arrays and prints the sum of their border elements. 

Here is a more detailed description:

The code begins by reading in a value 'k' from the user. This 'k' value specifies how many 2D arrays will be provided.

Then, the program starts a loop with index 'i' from 1 to 'k'. For each instance of the loop:

    Firstly, it reads in two numbers (m[i] and n[i]) specifying the number of rows and columns for the 'i'-th 2D array.

    Then, it reads in m[i]*n[i] numbers from the user as the elements of the 2D array 'a' with m[i] rows and n[i] columns.

    If both m[i] and n[i] are 1 (i.e., the array is 1x1), it prints the only element of 'a'. 

    For larger arrays, it finds and prints the sum of their border elements which are top row, bottom row, left column, and right column. It subtracts all corner elements since they are added twice in the sum. 

After all arrays have been processed, the code ends by exiting the 'main' function with a status code of 0 which indicates that the program has run successfully.
