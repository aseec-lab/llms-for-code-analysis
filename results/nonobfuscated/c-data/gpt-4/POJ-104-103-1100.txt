The given code is written in C programming language.

This program takes an input string from a user, converts all the alphabets in the string to uppercase, counts the frequency of each character in the string and finally prints out the characters and their count in tuples.

Here is a step-wise explanation:

1. Gets the user input string `a` and calculates its length `m`.
2. The for loop converts each character of string `a` to upper case and stores it in string `b`.
3. After conversion, it initializes `c[0]` as `1` and `e[0]` as `b[0]`.
4. The next for loop compares each character of `b` with its previous character. If they are the same, it increments the count of the current character in array `c`.
5. If they are not the same, it moves to the next character and store it in array `e` and increments the count for that character.
6. Finally, the program prints out the characters in `e` and their respective counts in `c`.

Note: The function `gets()` is dangerous and should not be used, because if the input string is longer than the declared array size, it can overflow and cause undefined behaviors. It's more secure to use `fgets()` instead. The code also does not validate if the input character is alphabetic before changing the case, non-alphabetic characters will be treated as low case characters.
