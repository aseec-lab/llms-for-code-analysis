The code takes an input string from the user and analyzes it. 

1. Declaring variables: The code declares variables 'i', 'm', 'k' as integers and creates an integer array 'c' of size 1000 and assigns all elements 0. It also creates character arrays 'a', 'b', and 'e' of size 1000.

2. Input: The code uses 'gets(a)' to take a string input from the user and assigns it to the 'a' array.

3. Finding string length: The code uses 'strlen(a)' to find the length of the input string 'a' and assigns it to 'm'.

4. Conversion to uppercase: The code uses a loop to iterate through each character of the input string 'a'. If the character is a lowercase letter (ASCII value < 'a'), it assigns the corresponding uppercase letter to the 'b' array. If the character is already uppercase, it directly copies it to the 'b' array.

5. Counting consecutive characters: The code initializes 'c[0]' and 'e[0]' to 1 and the first element of 'b' respectively. Then, it initializes 'k' to 0. The code uses a loop starting from 1 to 'm' (length of input string) to compare each character of 'b' with the previous character. If they are the same, it increments 'c[k]' by 1. If they are different, it increments 'k' by 1, assigns 'b[i]' to 'e[k]', and increments 'c[k]' by 1.

6. Printing the result: The code uses a loop to iterate through each element of 'e' and 'c' arrays until 'k-1' and prints the character and its corresponding count in the format "(character,count)".
