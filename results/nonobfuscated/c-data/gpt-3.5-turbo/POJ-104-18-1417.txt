This code appears to perform the following tasks:

1. Declare variables:
- `a` - a 2D array with dimensions 101x101 to store input values
- `n` - an integer to store the size of the array
- `p` - a pointer to a 1D array

2. Get input for `n` from the user.

3. Enter a loop that runs `n` times.
   - In each iteration:
     - Reset `n` to its original value.
     - Set `s` (sum) to 0.
     - Read `n`x`n` values from the user into the 2D array `a`.

4. Enter a loop that runs until `n` becomes 1.
   - In each iteration, reduce the size of the 2D array and manipulate its values.
   - For each row:
     - Find the minimum value in the row.
     - Subtract the minimum value from each element in that row.
   - For each column:
     - Find the minimum value in the column.
     - Subtract the minimum value from each element in that column.
   - Add the value at position (1, 1) of the matrix to `s` (the sum).
   - Shift the remaining elements of the first row and column to the left and up, respectively.
   - Shift the remaining elements of the matrix to create a new smaller matrix.

5. Print the value of `s` (the sum) for each iteration.

Overall, it seems that this code is calculating the sum of certain values in a matrix by repeatedly reducing its size and manipulating its elements.
