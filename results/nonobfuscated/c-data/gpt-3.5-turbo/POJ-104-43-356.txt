The code takes an input value 'm' from the user and checks if it is an even number. If it is not even, the code prints "input error". If 'm' is even, the code proceeds to execute the following steps:

1. Calculate the value of 'n' as half of 'm'.
2. Iterate a loop from 'i' = 3 to 'n', incrementing 'i' and decrementing 't' by 1 in each iteration.
3. Within the loop, iterate another loop from 'a' = 2 to 'i' - 1, checking if 'i' is divisible by any number between 2 and 'i'-1.
4. If the condition 'i%a != 0' is true for all values of 'a', it means 'i' is a prime number.
5. Within the prime number check, iterate a new loop from 'a' = 2 to 't' - 1, checking if 't' is divisible by any number between 2 and 't'-1.
6. If the condition 't%a != 0' is true for all values of 'a', it means 't' is a prime number.
7. If both 'i' and 't' are prime numbers, print them followed by a space (' ') and a new line ('\n').
8. After printing the prime numbers, there are two empty 'else' statements, which do nothing.
9. Finally, the code has two 'cin.get()' statements to pause the console before ending the program.

In summary, the purpose of the code is to find pairs of prime numbers such that one is 'i' and the other is 't', where 'i' and 't' are consecutive odd numbers starting from 3 and ending at 'm-2' (where 'm' is a given even number).
