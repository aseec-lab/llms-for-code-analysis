This code defines a function called "fun" and a main function. 

The "fun" function takes in three integer parameters: "m", "n", and "j". It initializes two variables, "i" and "s", with "i" being an integer and "s" being an integer initialized to 0.

The first if statement checks if "n" is equal to 1. If it is, the function returns whether "m" is greater than or equal to "j". Otherwise, the function proceeds to the next statement.

The loop initializes "i" with "j" and continues as long as "i" is less than "m". Inside the loop, it recursively calls the "fun" function with the following parameters: "m - i", "n - 1", and "i". The return value of each recursive call is added to the variable "s". Once the loop completes, the function returns "s".

The main function declares four integer variables: "n", "m", "s", and "t".

It then reads an integer value from the input and stores it in "t". It enters a while loop that executes "t" number of times.

Inside the while loop, it reads two integer values, "m" and "n", from the input. It then checks if "n" is greater than "m" and if it is, assigns the value of "m" to "n".

Next, it calls the "fun" function with the parameters "m", "n", and 0, and assigns the return value to "s".

Finally, it prints the value of "s" followed by a new line.

The main function continues to execute until the while loop condition becomes false, and then it returns 0.
