This code appears to be written in C and performs the following actions:

1. Declares an array of 50 strings, each with a length of 20 characters, called "a".
2. Declares an array of 50 integers, called "b".
3. Declares integers "n" (used to store input), "i" (used for looping), "j" (currently not used), and "c" (used to store the length of each string).
4. Uses scanf() to read an integer from the user and store it in "n".
5. Starts a loop that runs "n" times.
6. Within the loop, uses scanf() to read a string from the user and store it in the "i"th element of "a".
7. Starts another loop that runs "n" times.
8. Within this loop, assigns the length of the "i"th string in "a" to the "i"th element of "b".
9. Starts a third loop that runs "n" times.
10. Within this loop, assigns the value of "b[i]" to the variable "c".
11. Checks if the last character of the "i"th string in "a" is 'g'.
12. If it is 'g', it sets the last three characters of the string to '\0' (i.e., null terminators).
13. If it is not 'g', it sets the last two characters of the string to '\0'.
14. Prints the modified string to the console using printf().
15. The main() function ends.
