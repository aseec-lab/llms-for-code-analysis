This code appears to be calculating the area of a rectangular region within the given matrix where all elements are equal to 0. 

Here is a breakdown of the code:

1. The main function starts by declaring some variables: N, array, i, j, a, b, c, and d. N is used to determine the size of the matrix, array is a dynamic two-dimensional array (matrix) of integers, i and j are loop variables, and a, b, c, and d are used to keep track of the boundaries of the rectangular region.

2. The scanf function is used to read the value of N from the user.

3. Memory is dynamically allocated for the array using the malloc function. N rows are allocated, and for each row, N integers are allocated.

4. Nested for loops are used to iterate over each element of the matrix. The scanf function is used again to read the value of each element from the user.

5. Two if statements check if the current element is equal to 0. If it is, the if statement inside the first if statement checks if the current element is at a smaller row and column index than the previously recorded smallest row and column index (a and b). If it is, the smallest row and column indices are updated. Similarly, the if statement inside the second if statement checks if the current element is at a larger row and column index than the previously recorded largest row and column index (c and d). If it is, the largest row and column indices are updated.

6. After the nested loop finishes, the printf function is used to output the value of (c-a-1)*(d-b-1). This represents the area of the rectangular region within the matrix where all elements are equal to 0.
