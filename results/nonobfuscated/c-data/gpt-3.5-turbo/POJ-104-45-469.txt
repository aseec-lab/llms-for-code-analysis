This code is a program that takes two strings as input and searches for the first occurrence of the second string within the first string. 

The main function begins with declaring an array `s` of characters with a size of 50 and an array `w` of characters with the same size. It also declares a pointer `p` of character type, and two integers `i` and `k`.

Then, the code reads two strings from the user using the `scanf` function and stores them in the arrays `s` and `w`.

The next part is a nested loop. The outer loop iterates over the characters of the string `w` using the pointer `p`. It ends when the pointer `p` reaches the end of the string `w`, which is indicated by `w+strlen(w)`.

Inside the outer loop, the code sets `k` to 0. Then, it enters another loop that iterates over the characters of the string `s`, comparing each character with the character at the corresponding position in `w+p`. If there is a mismatch between any characters, the `k` variable is set to 1.

After the inner loop finishes, the code checks if `k` is still 0. If it is, it means that the second string `s` is found within the first string `w` starting from the current position pointed by `p`. In that case, the code prints the position of the starting point of the second string `s` in the first string `w` by subtracting `w` from `p`, and then breaks the outer loop.

Finally, the program ends and control returns to the operating system.
