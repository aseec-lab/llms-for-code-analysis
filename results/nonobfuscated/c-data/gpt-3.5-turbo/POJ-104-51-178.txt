This code takes in an input integer n followed by a string a. It then creates substrings of length n from the string a and stores them in a two-dimensional character array b. The code then counts the number of occurrences of each substring in b and stores the count in an integer array num.

After counting the occurrences, the code sorts the substrings in descending order based on their number of occurrences. Finally, it prints the substring with the highest occurrence count, as well as any other substrings that have the same count as the highest.

If the substring with the highest occurrence count has a count of 0, the code prints "NO" instead.
