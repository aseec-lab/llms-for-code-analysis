This code includes two header files: `unistd.h` and `stdio.h`. 

The `unistd.h` header provides access to the POSIX operating system API, including the sysconf function. 

The `stdio.h` header provides input and output operations, including the printf function.

The main function is defined, which is the entry point of the program.

Within the main function, the printf function is used to print the result of the sysconf function. The sysconf function takes a constant, `_SC_CLK_TCK`, which refers to the number of clock ticks per second. The result is printed as an integer.

Finally, the function returns 0, indicating successful termination of the program.
