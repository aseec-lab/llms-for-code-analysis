This code is designed to find and display the two largest numbers in an array of integers.

The code starts by initializing variables: i, j, p, a, and n. 
- i and j are used as loop counters.
- p is a temporary variable used for swapping values in the array.
- a is an array of size 101, initialized with all elements set to 0.
- n is a variable used to store the number of elements in the array.

Next, the code uses the cin function to read the value of n from the user.

Then, a for loop is used to iterate from i = 1 to i = n, and within this loop, the code uses cin again to read the values of the array elements from the user.

After that, there are two nested for loops. The outer loop iterates from j = 1 to j = n-1, and the inner loop iterates from i = 1 to i = n-j.

Inside the inner loop, an if statement checks if the current element a[i] is less than the next element a[i+1]. If this condition is true, it means the two elements are in the wrong order, so the code swaps them by assigning the value of a[i] to p, assigning the value of a[i+1] to a[i], and assigning the value of p to a[i+1].

This way, the largest element in the array will "bubble up" to the end of the array in each iteration of the inner loop.

After the nested for loops, the code outputs the first two elements of the sorted array using cout.

Finally, the code returns 0 to indicate successful execution of the program.
