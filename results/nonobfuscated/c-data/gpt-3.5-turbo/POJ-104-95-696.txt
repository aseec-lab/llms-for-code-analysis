This code analyzes and compares two strings that are input by the user. 

In the first part of the code, it declares two character arrays, `str1` and `str2`, with a maximum size of 80 characters each. It then declares an integer variable `i`.

The next two lines use `cin.getline()` to get input from the user for `str1` and `str2`, respectively.

The `for` loop iterates from 0 to 80, inclusively. 

Within the loop, there are two `if` statements. The first `if` statement checks if the character at index `i` in `str1` is an uppercase letter (between 'A' and 'Z') by comparing its ASCII value. If it is, it converts it to lowercase by adding 32 to its ASCII value. The same process is repeated for `str2` in the second `if` statement.

After the loop, the code uses `strcmp()` to compare `str1` and `str2`. 

- If the result of the comparison is 0, it means the strings are equal, so the code prints '='.
- If the result is greater than 0 (str1>str2), it means `str1` is lexicographically greater than `str2`, so the code prints '>'.
- If the result is less than 0 (str1<str2), it means `str1` is lexicographically smaller than `str2`, so the code prints '<'.

Finally, 0 is returned from the main function.
