This code reads an integer input 'n' and performs calculations to determine the number of certain denominations of currency needed to represent 'n' as a sum of money. 

Here is a breakdown of how the code works:

1. The code declares and initializes integer variables 'n', 'b', 'ws', 'e', 's', 'w', and 'y'. 
2. The code uses the scanf() function to take user input and store it in the variable 'n'.
3. The code calculates the number of hundreds (b) by dividing 'n' by 100 and assigns it to the variable 'b'. It then updates 'n' to be the remainder after dividing by 100.
4. The code calculates the number of fifties (ws) by dividing 'n' by 50 and assigns it to the variable 'ws'. It then updates 'n' to be the remainder after dividing by 50.
5. The code calculates the number of twenties (e) by dividing 'n' by 20 and assigns it to the variable 'e'. It then updates 'n' to be the remainder after dividing by 20.
6. The code calculates the number of tens (s) by dividing 'n' by 10 and assigns it to the variable 's'. It then updates 'n' to be the remainder after dividing by 10.
7. The code calculates the number of fives (w) by dividing 'n' by 5 and assigns it to the variable 'w'. It then updates 'n' to be the remainder after dividing by 5.
8. The code calculates the number of ones (y) by assigning 'n' to the variable 'y' (since it's the remaining amount after all the calculations above).
9. The code prints the values of variables 'b', 'ws', 'e', 's', 'w', and 'y' using the printf() function.
10. The code returns 0 to indicate successful execution of the main() function.
