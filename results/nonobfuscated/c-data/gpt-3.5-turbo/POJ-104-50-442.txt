This code determines the months of the year that start with a Friday when given a specific day of the week for the first day of the year.

The main function begins by declaring two integer variables, w and i. 
The variable w represents the day of the week for the first day of the year, where 0 represents Sunday, 1 represents Monday, and so on.
The variable i represents the month of the year.

Then, the scanf function is used to read an integer value from the user and store it in the variable w.

Next, a for loop is used to iterate from 1 to 12, representing each month of the year.

Inside the for loop, there are several if statements. Each if statement corresponds to a specific month and checks if it starts with a Friday.

For example, the if statement with i==1 checks if January starts with a Friday. It does this by using the condition (w+12%7)%7==5, where % represents the modulo operator. If this condition is true, it means that the first day of January is a Friday and the code prints the value of i (1) using the printf function.

Similar if statements are used for other months, with different calculations to determine if the first day of each month is a Friday.

Finally, the main function returns 0 to indicate successful execution.

In conclusion, this code accepts a day of the week for the first day of the year and determines which months of the year start with a Friday. It then prints the corresponding months.
