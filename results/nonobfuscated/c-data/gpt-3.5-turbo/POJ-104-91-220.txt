This code takes two strings as input, calculates the length of the first string, and performs some operations to create a new string. 

1. The code declares two pointers to character arrays, `s1` and `s2`.
2. It dynamically allocates memory for each array, with each able to store 100 characters.
3. The `gets()` function is used to read input from the user and store it in `s1`.
4. The length of `s1` is calculated using the `strlen()` function and stored in the variable `len`.
5. A for loop is initiated to iterate through the characters of `s1`, starting from the first character and ending at the second-to-last character.
6. Inside the loop, the value of `s1[i]` and `s1[i+1]` are added and assigned to `s2[i]`. This means each character in `s2` is the sum of two characters from `s1`.
7. After the loop, the first character of `s1` and the last character of `s1` are added together and assigned to the last position of `s2` (`s2[len-1]`).
8. Another for loop is used to print each character of `s2` using the `printf()` function.
9. The program ends.
