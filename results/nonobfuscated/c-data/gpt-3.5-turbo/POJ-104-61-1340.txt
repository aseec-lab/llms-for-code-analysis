The code reads in a value for n, creates two arrays of size n (a and b), and then reads in n values to populate array a. 

Then, a loop iterates through each value in a. Within this loop, there is another loop that calculates the Fibonacci sequence up to array a's value minus one. 

The Fibonacci sequence is calculated by initializing p=0 and q=1. Then, for each value from 0 to a[j]-2, the algorithm calculates the next Fibonacci number by storing the current value of q in r, updating p to the previous value of q, and updating q to the sum of p and r.

Finally, the calculated Fibonacci number (q) is outputted, and this loop continues until all values in a have been processed.

Overall, the code calculates and outputs the Fibonacci numbers for each element in array a.
