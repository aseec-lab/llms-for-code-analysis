This code reads an integer 'k' from input and then executes a loop 'k' times. 

Within each iteration of the loop, the code reads two integers 'm' and 'n' from input. It then reads a matrix 'a' with dimensions 'm' x 'n'. 

If the dimensions of the matrix are both 1, the code simply prints the value at index [1][1]. Otherwise, the code calculates the sum of the elements along the borders of the matrix (excluding the corners) and stores it in the variable 'sum'. 

Finally, the code subtracts the values of the corner elements from the sum and prints the result.
