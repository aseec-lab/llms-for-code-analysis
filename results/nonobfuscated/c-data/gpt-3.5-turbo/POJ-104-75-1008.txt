The code reads in two sequences of numbers, `come` and `leave`, representing the arrival and departure times of people. 

First, it initializes an array `a` of size 1001 with all elements set to 0.

Then, it reads in the values for the `come` array until it encounters a newline character ('\n'). It does this by continuously reading values into `come[num]` and checking if the next character is a newline. If it is, it breaks out of the loop.

Next, it does the same thing for the `leave` array.

Then, it enters a nested for loop. The outer loop iterates through the values of `come` and `leave` arrays, while the inner loop iterates from the arrival time to the departure time for each person. Inside the inner loop, it increments the corresponding element in the `a` array by 1.

After the loops finish, it initializes a `temp` variable with the value of the first element in the `a` array.

Then, it goes through the `a` array starting from the second element and checks if each element is greater than or equal to `temp`. If it is, it updates the `temp` variable with the new element.

Finally, it outputs the number of people (stored in `num` variable) plus 1, and the maximum value in the `a` array (stored in `temp` variable).

Overall, the code calculates the maximum number of people present at any given time, based on the arrival and departure times.
