The code takes in a sentence as input and removes multiple consecutive spaces from it.

The code starts by declaring an integer variable `i` and a character array `a` with a size of 101.

`cin.getline(a, 101);` reads a line of input from the user and stores it in the character array `a`.

Next, a pointer variable `p` is declared and initialized to point to the start of the character array `a`.

The for loop iterates over each character in the input sentence. The loop condition `i < strlen(a)` ensures that the loop executes until all characters in the array `a` have been traversed.

Inside the loop, there is an `if-else` statement that checks if the current character `a[i]` is a space (' ') and if the next character `a[i + 1]` is also a space. If this condition is true, it means that there are consecutive spaces. In this case, the pointer `p` is incremented by 1 to skip one space. This effectively removes consecutive spaces from the output.

If the condition in the `if` statement is false, it means that the current character is not a space or it is the last space in a group of consecutive spaces. In this case, the character pointed to by `p` is printed using `cout`, and then the pointer `p` is incremented by 1.

After the loop finishes executing, the function `main` returns 0, indicating successful execution of the program.
