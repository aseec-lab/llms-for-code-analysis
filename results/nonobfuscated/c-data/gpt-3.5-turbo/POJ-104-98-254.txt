This code reads in a set of strings from the user and prints them out in a formatted way. 

1. First, the code declares and initializes some variables: n (for the number of strings), i (a loop variable), count (to keep track of the total length of the strings printed so far), and len (to store the length of the current string being processed).

2. The code then reads in the variable n from the user.

3. Next, the code sets up a pointer to access the array of strings named "str". The pointer p is initialized to point to the first element of the str array.

4. The code then enters a loop that reads in n strings from the user and stores them in the str array using the pointer p.

5. The code then enters another loop that iterates over every string in the str array, except for the last one. It does the following:

   - It calculates the length of the current string.
   - It checks if adding the length of the current string to the count will exceed 80 characters.
   - If not, it checks if adding the length of the current string, plus 1 for the space character, plus the length of the next string will exceed 80 characters.
   - If adding the current string and the next string would not exceed 80 characters, it prints the current string followed by a space character, and updates the count variable accordingly.
   - If adding the current and next string would exceed 80 characters, it prints just the current string on a new line, resets the count variable to 0, and adds a "#" character on a new line.
   - If adding the length of the current string to the count exceeds 80 characters, it prints the "#" character on a new line followed by the current string, and updates the count variable accordingly.

6. After the loop, the code calculates the length of the last string and checks if adding it to the count would exceed 80 characters. If not, it prints the last string on a new line. If it would exceed 80 characters, it just prints the last string on a new line.

7. Finally, the code returns 0 to indicate successful execution of the program.
