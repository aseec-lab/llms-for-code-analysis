This code appears to be a program that takes in six integer inputs (x, y, z, a, b, and c) repeatedly until the input is all zeros. 

Inside the while loop, it checks if all the input variables are zero. If they are, the loop is broken using the break statement. Otherwise, it proceeds to calculate the result using the given formula.

The formula for calculating the result is as follows:
result = ((60 - y - 1) * 60) + (60 - z) + (60 * b) + c + ((a + 12 - x - 1) * 60 * 60)

Finally, the result is printed using printf and the while loop continues until the input is all zeros.
