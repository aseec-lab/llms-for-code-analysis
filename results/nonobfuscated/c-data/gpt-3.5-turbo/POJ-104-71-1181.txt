This code appears to be checking whether a given set of dates fall on a day that is a multiple of 7 (i.e., a Sunday). 

The program begins with defining integer variables n, i, a[200], b[200], c[200], sum, d, and e. 

The user is prompted to input a value for n. Then, the program enters a for loop that iterates from i=0 to i=n-1. 

Within the for loop, the program reads three integer values into a[i], b[i], and c[i] using scanf(). These values represent a year, a month, and a day, respectively. 

Next, the program checks if b[i] (the month) is greater than c[i] (the day). If it is, the program swaps the values of b[i] and c[i] using a temporary variable d. 

The program then checks if a[i] (the year) is divisible by 4 and not divisible by 100, or if it is divisible by 400. If this condition is true, the program enters another for loop. 

Within this nested for loop, the program calculates the number of days passed from b[i] to c[i] based on the month (e) using a switch statement. The corresponding number of days is added to the sum variable. 

After the nested for loop, the program checks if the sum is divisible by 7. If it is, the program prints "YES". If it isn't, the program prints "NO". 

If the condition a[i]%4==0&&a[i]%100!=0||a[i]%400==0 is false, the program enters another nested for loop. 

Within this nested for loop, the program calculates the number of days passed from b[i] to c[i] based on the month (e) using a switch statement. The corresponding number of days is added to the sum variable. 

After the nested for loop, the program checks if the sum is divisible by 7. If it is, the program prints "YES". If it isn't, the program prints "NO". 

Finally, after the for loop ends, the program returns 0.
