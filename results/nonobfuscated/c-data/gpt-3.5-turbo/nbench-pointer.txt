This code includes the standard input/output library, `stdio.h`, which provides input/output functionalities such as `printf`. 

In the `main` function:

1. The `printf` function is used to print the size of a `long` integer in bytes. The `%d` format specifier is used to print the size as an integer.

2. `(int)sizeof(long)` is a cast expression that calculates the size of the `long` data type in bytes using the `sizeof` operator. The `sizeof` operator returns the number of bytes occupied by a data type.

3. The result of `(int)sizeof(long)` is printed using `printf`.

4. Finally, `return(0)` terminates the `main` function and returns 0, indicating successful execution.
