This code appears to define a structure called "student" which has several fields such as num, name, sex, old, score, and add. Each student structure also has a pointer to another student structure called "next".

In the main function, the code begins by declaring two pointers to student structures, p1 and p2. It also declares an integer variable len which is assigned the size of the student structure.

The next line allocates memory for a student structure using malloc and assigns the pointer to p1. The next pointer of p1 is set to NULL.

The program then enters a while loop that reads input from the user using scanf until the user enters "end" for the num field. Inside the loop, the code reads values for the name, sex, old, score, and add fields of the p1 structure. It then assigns p2 to p1 and again allocates memory for a new student structure and assigns it to p1. The next pointer of the new p1 points to p2. The code then continues to read a new value for the num field.

After the loop ends (when the user enters "end"), another loop is executed to print the values of each student structure. This loop starts from the next pointer of p1 and continues until p1->next is NULL. Inside the loop, the code prints the values of the num, name, sex, old, score, and add fields of the current student structure.

Overall, this code allows the user to input student information and stores it in a linked list of student structures. It then prints the information of each student in reverse order of input.
