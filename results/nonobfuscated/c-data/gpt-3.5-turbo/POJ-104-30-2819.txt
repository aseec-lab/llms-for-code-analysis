This code calculates the sum of squares of numbers that satisfy certain conditions. 

1. The code starts by declaring integer variables `n`, `s`, `a`, `b`, `c`, and `i`. `n` will be input by the user, `s` will store the sum of squares, `a`, `b`, and `c` will be used for checking conditions, and `i` will be used as a loop variable.

2. The code then reads an integer input from the user and assigns it to the variable `n` using `cin` (input stream).

3. The code enters a `for` loop that iterates from `i=1` to `i<=n`.

4. Inside the loop, the code performs the following calculations:

   - `a = i % 7;` calculates the remainder when `i` is divided by 7.
   - `b = i % 10;` calculates the remainder when `i` is divided by 10.
   - `c = i / 10;` calculates the integer division of `i` by 10.

5. The code then checks three conditions using nested `if` statements:

   - `if (a != 0)` checks if `i` is not divisible by 7.
   - `if (b != 7)` checks if `i` does not end with the digit 7.
   - `if (c != 7)` checks if `i` does not start with the digit 7.

6. If all three conditions are satisfied (`a`, `b`, and `c` are not equal to 0 or 7), the code calculates `s += i*i`, which adds the square of `i` to the sum `s`.

7. After the loop finishes, the code outputs the value of `s` using `cout` (output stream).

8. Finally, the code returns 0 to indicate successful execution of the `main` function.
