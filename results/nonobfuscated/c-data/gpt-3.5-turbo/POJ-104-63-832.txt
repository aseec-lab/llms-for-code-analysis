This code takes input of two matrices, multiplies them, and prints the resulting matrix.

- The code declares variables `x1`, `y1`, `x2`, `y2`, `i`, `j`, `k` as integers.
- The code declares three 2D arrays of size 100x100 named `a`, `b`, and `c`.
- The code takes input of two integers `x1` and `y1`, representing the dimensions of the first matrix.
- Then, in a nested for loop, the code takes input of `x1 * y1` integers and stores them in the array `a`.
- The code takes input of two integers `x2` and `y2`, representing the dimensions of the second matrix.
- Similar to the previous step, the code takes input of `x2 * y2` integers and stores them in the array `b`.
- Then, another nested for loop is used to calculate the product of the two matrices and store the result in the array `c`.
- Finally, a while loop is used to print the elements of the resulting matrix `c`.

Overall, this code performs matrix multiplication. It takes input of two matrices, multiplies them, and prints the resulting matrix.
