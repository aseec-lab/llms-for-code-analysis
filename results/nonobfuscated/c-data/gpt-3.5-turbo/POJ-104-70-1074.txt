This code first declares a struct called "point" with two variables, x and y, which represent the coordinates of a point in a plane. 

In the main function, it accepts an integer input 'n' using scanf to represent the number of points that will be entered. It then allocates memory for an array of 'n' point structures using malloc. 

The code then proceeds to read the coordinates for each point using a loop and scanf. 

Next, it allocates memory for an array of 'n-1' doubles using malloc and initializes all elements to 0. 

Then, the code computes the distance between each pair of points using nested loops. It calculates the distance using the distance formula and stores the maximum distance for each point in the 'd' array. 

After that, it finds the maximum distance among all points and assigns it to the variable 'max'. 

Finally, it prints the maximum distance with 4 decimal places using printf. 

The last three getchar statements are used to prevent the console window from closing immediately after the program finishes executing.
