This code takes a user input string and removes consecutive spaces from it.

- The main() function is defined.
- Variables i and j are declared as integers and set to 0.
- Arrays s and m are declared as character arrays with a size of 201. m is also initialized with all elements set to 0.
- The gets() function is used to read a string input from the user and store it in the array s.
- A for loop is initialized with i set to 0 and the loop continues until the null character ('\0') is encountered in the array s.
- Inside the loop, an if statement is used to check if the current character in s is not a space or if it is a space, but the next character is not a space. If either condition is true, the following code is executed:
  - The current character in s is assigned to the j-th index of the array m.
  - j is then incremented by 1.
- After the loop finishes, the puts() function is used to print out the modified string stored in the array m.
- The main function returns 0 to indicate the successful execution of the program.
