This code takes in two integers, n and k, from the user. It then initializes an array of size 1001, with all elements set to 0. The code then enters a loop with an initial value of i=1. 

Inside the loop, the array element at index n is set to n*i+k. This is followed by another loop that starts from n-1 and decrements j by 1 each time. The loop checks if the value of a[j+1] modulo (n-1) is not equal to 0. If it is not equal to 0, the loop breaks. Otherwise, the else block is executed where the value of a[j] is calculated using the formula a[j+1]*n/(n-1)+k. 

After the inner loop, an if condition checks if the value at index 1 of array a is not equal to 0. If it is not equal to 0, it prints the value and breaks out of the loop. 

Overall, this code is trying to calculate and print a value by iteratively updating the elements of the array a based on the given formulas, until the value at index 1 is non-zero.
