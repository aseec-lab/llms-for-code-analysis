This code takes an input value for "n" and then proceeds to iterate "n" times.

Within each iteration, it takes an input value for "m" and initializes the variable "sum" to 0. An array "a" of size 100 is also declared.

If "m" is equal to 0, the code outputs "60" and moves on to the next iteration.

Otherwise, it takes "m" input values and stores them in the array "a". 

The code then proceeds to iterate through the elements in "a".

For each element, if the element is less than 59, the value of "sum" is incremented by 3. 

If the sum of the element and "sum" is greater than 63, it subtracts 3 from "sum", outputs 60 minus "sum", and breaks out of the loop.

If the sum of the element and "sum" is greater than 60, it outputs the element value and breaks out of the loop.

If the iteration reaches the last element in "a", the code outputs 60 minus "sum".

At the end of each iteration, the loop repeats until all "n" iterations are completed, and then the main function returns 0.
