This code is a program for brute-forcing tripcodes for Futaba-style imageboards. It takes a query string as input and generates random tripcodes until a match is found. The program uses OpenMP for parallel processing, with the number of threads determined by the number of available CPU cores.

The code includes several header files for standard libraries, as well as additional libraries like OpenSSL for cryptographic functions. It also defines various constants and types.

The main function initializes variables and locks, parses command line arguments, and displays a splash message. It then generates random tripcodes until a match is found or a break signal is received. When a match is found, the relevant information is printed to the console.

Other functions in the code handle tasks like generating random numbers, validating and processing query strings, computing tripcode statistics, and handling signal interruptions.

Overall, the code runs a parallel tripcode brute-force algorithm and provides feedback on the average rate of matches found.
