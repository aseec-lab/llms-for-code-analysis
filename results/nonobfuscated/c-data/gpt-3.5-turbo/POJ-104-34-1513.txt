This code prompts the user to input a number, reads the input into the variable 'n', and initializes variables 'k' and 'sum' to 0.

The code then enters a while loop that continues until 'n' is equal to 1. Inside the loop, the code displays the value of 'n' using cout. 

If 'n' is divisible by 2 (i.e., 'n' % 2 is not 0), the code prints "*3+1=" and updates the value of 'n' by multiplying it by 3 and adding 1. 

If 'n' is not divisible by 2, the code prints "/2=" and updates the value of 'n' by dividing it by 2. 

Finally, after the while loop ends, the code displays "End" and returns 0.
