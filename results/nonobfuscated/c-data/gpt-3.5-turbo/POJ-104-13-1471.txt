This code takes an input integer `n` and an array `a` of size 20001. It then reads `n` integers into the array `a`. 

After that, it initializes a variable `num` to 0. It then iterates over the array `a` and for each element at index `i`, it checks if there is any duplicate element before it (at indices from 1 to `i-1`). If a duplicate is found, the current element `a[i]` is set to 0, the `num` variable is incremented, and the inner loop breaks. This process is done to eliminate duplicate numbers from the array `a` and keep track of the number of duplicates.

After the duplicate elimination process, the code initializes a variable `j` to 0. It then iterates over the array `a` again and for each non-zero element `a[i]`, it increments `j` and checks if `j` is not equal to `n - num` (i.e., if it is not the last non-zero element in the array). If it is not the last element, it prints `a[i]` followed by a space. If it is the last element, it prints `a[i]` without a trailing space and breaks out of the loop.

Finally, the code reads another integer `n` but doesn't do anything with it. It returns 0.

So, overall, this code removes duplicate elements from an array and prints the array without any duplicates in the original order.
