This code reads an integer value 'n' from the user as the dimension of a square room. It then reads 'n' rows of characters representing the state of the room: '.' represents an empty space, '#' represents a wall, and '@' represents a person.

After reading the room state, the code reads an integer value 'day' from the user. The following loop simulates the movement of the people in the room for 'day' number of days. For each day, the code checks each cell in the room:
- If the cell contains a person (value 1), the code checks the neighboring cells. If a neighboring cell contains an empty space (value 2), the person in the current cell moves to the empty space, and the value of the empty space cell is changed to 3.
- After checking all cells, the code updates all cells with value 3 (indicating that a person moved to that cell) to value 1 (indicating the presence of a person).

Finally, the code counts the number of cells with value 1 (indicating the presence of a person) and outputs the result.

In summary, this code simulates the movement of people in a square room for a given number of days and counts the number of people present in the room after the simulation.
