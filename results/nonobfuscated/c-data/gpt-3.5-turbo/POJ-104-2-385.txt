This code defines a struct called "book" and an array of structs called "test". The struct has two members: an integer called "num" and a character array called "w" with a size of 26.

The main function starts by declaring several variables: m, i, j, n, and s are integers, while x and c are characters.

The program then prompts the user to input a value for m and reads it with scanf.

Next, there is a for loop that runs m times. Inside the loop, the program prompts the user to input an integer and a string, which are stored in the num and w members of the book array.

After reading all the input, the program sets x to 'A', n to 0, and c to 'A'.

The program then enters a while loop that will continue indefinitely until it encounters a break statement. Inside the loop, s is set to 0.

There is another nested for loop that iterates over the book array and the characters in each book's w member. If a character is equal to x, then s is incremented.

After the nested for loop, there is an if statement that checks if s is greater than n. If so, n is updated with the value of s, and c is updated with the value of x.

There is another if statement that checks if x is equal to 'Z' in order to break out of the while loop. Before breaking, x is incremented.

After the while loop, the program prints the values of c and n using printf.

Finally, there is another nested for loop that iterates over the book array and the characters in each book's w member. If a character is equal to c, the program prints the corresponding book's num member.

The program ends by returning 0.
