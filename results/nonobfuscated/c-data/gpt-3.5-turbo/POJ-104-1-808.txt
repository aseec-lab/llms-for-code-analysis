The code defines a function `fenjie` that recursively factors a given number `n` into its prime factors. It initializes a variable `sum` to 0 at the beginning.

The `fenjie` function takes two parameters, `t` and `n`, where `t` represents the start of the factor range and `n` is the number to be factored. Inside the function, it initializes a variable `i` to 0 and checks if `n` is equal to 1. If `n` is indeed equal to 1, it increments the `sum` variable by 1.

After that, it enters a for loop that starts at `t` and iterates up to `n`. In each iteration, it checks if `n` is divisible by `i`. If it is, the function calls itself recursively with `i` as the new `t` value and `n/i` as the new `n` value.

The main function prompts the user to enter a value for `n`. It then enters a while loop that continues until `n` becomes 0. In each iteration, it prompts the user to enter a value for `k`, resets the `sum` variable to 0, calls the `fenjie` function with `t` as 2 and `k` as `n`, decrements `n` by 1, and finally prints the current value of `sum`.

Overall, the code calculates and prints the number of prime factors for each input number `k` entered by the user.
