This code begins by declaring and initializing several variables including `m` and `n` indicating the number of rows and columns of a matrix, and `a` which is a two-dimensional array representing the matrix. 

It then reads the values for `m` and `n` from the user using `scanf`. 

After that, there is a nested loop that reads the values for each cell of the matrix using `scanf`.

The variable `num` is calculated as the total number of elements in the matrix (m*n).

The variables `sxrow`, `xxrow`, `sxcol`, and `xxcol` are initialized to track the boundaries of the matrix.

Next, there is a while loop that continues until `s` is equal to `num`. 

Inside the while loop, there are several nested loops, each printing the elements in a spiral pattern starting from the outermost layer of the matrix and moving towards the center. 

The first nested loop prints the elements of the first row from index `xxcol` to `sxcol`, incrementing `s` after each print. 

The second nested loop prints the elements of the last column from index `xxrow+1` to `sxrow`, incrementing `s` after each print. 

The third nested loop prints the elements of the last row in reverse order from index `sxcol-1` to `xxcol`, incrementing `s` after each print.

The fourth nested loop prints the elements of the first column in reverse order from index `sxrow-1` to `xxrow`, incrementing `s` after each print. 

After each nested loop, there are conditions to check if `s` is equal to `num`. If it is, the loop is terminated using `break`.

Finally, outside of the while loop, the code returns 0 indicating successful execution of the program.
