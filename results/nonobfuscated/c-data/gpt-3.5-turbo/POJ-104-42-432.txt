This code takes as input an array of numbers, represented by the variable `a`, and a number `num`. It removes any occurrences of `num` from the array and prints the modified array.

Here is a step-by-step breakdown of the code:

1. The code declares and initializes the variables `flag`, `n`, `i`, `num`, `j`, and `a`. The variable `flag` is used to print the space character between numbers.

2. The code reads the number of elements in the array (`n`) from the user.

3. The code reads the elements of the array (`a`) from the user.

4. The code reads the number (`num`) that needs to be removed from the array.

5. The code iterates through each element of the array and checks if it is equal to `num`.

6. If an element is found equal to `num`, it shifts all the subsequent elements one position to the left, effectively removing the element. It also decreases `n` by 1 and decrements `i` by 1 to account for the shifted elements.

7. After removing all occurrences of `num`, the code iterates through the modified array and prints the elements. It uses the `flag` variable to determine whether to print a space character before each element.

8. Finally, the code returns 0 to indicate successful execution.

In summary, the code removes all occurrences of a given number from an array and prints the modified array.
