This code appears to be analyzing a set of data represented by two arrays, `a` and `b`. 

The code starts by declaring and initializing several variables: `n`, `i`, `j`, `c`, `d`, `e`, and `f`. 

It then prompts the user to enter a value for `n` using `scanf()`. This value will determine the size of arrays `a` and `b`.

The code then enters a loop where it prompts the user to enter values for `a[i]` and `b[i]` for each value of `i` from `0` to `n-1`. 

After the data is inputted, the code enters another loop where it checks each pair of values `a[i]` and `b[i]`. 

If the values meet certain conditions (i.e., `a[i]` is between 90 and 140, `b[i]` is greater than 59 and less than or equal to 90), the code sets `d` to the current value of `i`. 

The code then enters another loop where it checks subsequent pairs of values `a[j]` and `b[j]`, starting from `d+1`. If the values also meet the conditions and the previous pair of values (`a[j-1]` and `b[j-1]`) also meet the conditions, `e` is set to the current value of `j`. 

If any of the conditions fail, the loop is broken. Once the loop ends, the code calculates the length of the sequence by subtracting `d` from `e` and adding `1` (`f = e - d + 1`). 

If `f` is greater than `c`, `c` is updated to `f`. This ensures that `c` is always the length of the longest sequence that meets the conditions.

Finally, the code prints the value of `c`.
