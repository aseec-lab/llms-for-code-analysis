This code appears to be a program that performs some calculations on a given input. 

Let's break down the code step by step:

1. The variables `a` and `q` are declared as character arrays with a size of 101. These arrays will be used to store the input and the result respectively.
2. The integer variables `i`, `rem`, `d`, and `b` are declared, with `i` initialized to 0, `rem` and `d` initialized to 0, and `b` declared as an array of size 101.
3. The `scanf` function is used to read a string from the user input and store it in the array `a`.
4. The code then checks various conditions using `if` and `else if` statements:
   - If `a[1]` is equal to the null character '\0', print "0" followed by the character `a[0]`.
   - Else if the concatenation of `(a[0]-'0')*10+a[1]-'0'` is less than 13 and `a[2]` is equal to the null character '\0', print "0" followed by the string `a`.
   - Otherwise, execute the following block of code.
5. In the else block, the value of `b[0]` is assigned the result of the calculation `10*(a[0]-'0')+a[1]-'0'`.
6. A loop is set up to iterate through the characters in `a`, starting from index 0 and ending at the second-to-last character (length of `a` minus 2).
7. Inside the loop, the variable `q[i]` is assigned the result of `b[i]/13` converted to a character.
8. The remainder of `b[i]` divided by 13 is assigned to `rem`.
9. The value of `b[i+1]` is assigned `a[i+2] + rem*10 - '0'`.
10. After the loop, the null character '\0' is appended to the end of `q`.
11. If the first character of `q` is '0', a loop is used to shift the characters of `q` one position to the left, effectively removing the leading '0'.
12. Finally, the result `q` is printed, followed by the value of `rem`.

In summary, this code takes a string as input, performs calculations on it, and outputs the result along with the value of the remainder. The specific calculations involve dividing the input string by 13 and keeping track of remainders.
