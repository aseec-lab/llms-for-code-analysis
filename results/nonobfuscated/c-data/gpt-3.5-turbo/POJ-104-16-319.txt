This code takes an integer input from the user and rearranges the digits in reverse order.

1. It declares several variables `n`, `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d`.
2. It prompts the user to enter a value for `n`.
3. It calculates the value of `a` by dividing `n` by 1000.
4. It calculates the value of `b` by getting the remainder of `n` divided by 1000 and then dividing it by 100.
5. It calculates the value of `c` by getting the remainder of `n` divided by 100 and then dividing it by 10.
6. It calculates the value of `d` by getting the remainder of `n` divided by 10.
7. It checks if `a` is not equal to 0. If true, it prints `d`, `c`, `b`, and `a` in reverse order.
8. If the condition in step 7 is not true, it checks if `b` is not equal to 0. If true, it prints `d`, `c`, and `b` in reverse order.
9. If the conditions in steps 7 and 8 are not true, it checks if `c` is not equal to 0. If true, it prints `d` and `c` in reverse order.
10. If none of the conditions in steps 7, 8, and 9 are true, it prints only `d`.
11. It returns 0 to indicate successful execution of the program.
