The code provided is written in the C programming language.

The first line includes the standard input-output library, `stdio.h`, which allows for input and output operations in the program.

The `main` function is the entry point of a C program. It returns an `int` value.

Inside the `main` function, `printf("hello.\n");` is called. `printf` is a function from the `stdio.h` library that prints the given string. In this case, it prints "hello." followed by a newline character `\n` to the standard output (usually the console screen).

After printing the string, `return(0);` is called which means the program execution is finished and it returns 0 as the exit status. In C programming, a return value of 0 often signifies that the program ran successfully.
