This code sorts a 2D array in ascending order based on the first element of each row, and then finds the maximum value of the second element in the sorted array. 

Here is a breakdown of the code:

1. Declare variables:
- `i`, `j`, `n`, `k`, `l`, `t1`, `t2`, `t3`, `t4`, `t5`: integer variables for loop counters and temporary values.
- `a[5000][2]`: a 2D array of size 5000x2 to store input values.

2. Read the value of `n` from the user.

3. Read the input values into the `a` array using nested `for` loops.

4. Sort the `a` array in ascending order based on the first element of each row using bubble sort algorithm.

5. Iterate over each element in the sorted array using nested `for` loops.

6. Within the loop, compare each element with all other elements to check if it falls within the range defined by the second element of the other elements.

7. If the condition in step 6 is satisfied for every element, set `t3` to 0 and print "no". Then break the loop.

8. If the condition in step 6 is not satisfied for any element, set `t3` to 1 and reset `t5` to 0.

9. Find the maximum value of the second element from the sorted array and store it in `t4`.

10. If `t3` is not equal to 0, print the first element of the first row of the `a` array and `t4` as the output.

11. Return 0 to indicate successful execution of the program.
