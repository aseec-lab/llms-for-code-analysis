This code analyzes a series of input numbers and categorizes them into four age groups: 1-18, 19-35, 36-60, and over 60. It then calculates the percentage of numbers in each category and outputs the results.

Here is a breakdown of the code:

1. Define all the necessary variables:
   - `i`: a counter variable for the loops
   - `e[100]`: an array to store the input numbers
   - `n`: a variable to store the total number of inputs
   - `a`, `b`, `c`, `d`: variables to count the numbers in each age group

2. Read the value of `n` from the user using `scanf`.

3. Use a `for` loop to read `n` numbers from the user and store them in the `e` array.

4. Use another `for` loop to iterate through each number in the `e` array.
   - If the number is less than or equal to 18, increment the `a` variable by 1.
   - If the number is between 19 and 35, increment the `b` variable by 1.
   - If the number is between 36 and 60, increment the `c` variable by 1.
   - If the number is greater than 60, increment the `d` variable by 1.

5. After counting the numbers in each category, calculate the percentage of numbers in each group by dividing the count by `n` and multiplying by 100.

6. Finally, output the results using `printf`:
   - Print the percentage of numbers in the 1-18 age group.
   - Print the percentage of numbers in the 19-35 age group.
   - Print the percentage of numbers in the 36-60 age group.
   - Print the percentage of numbers greater than 60.

Note: The output includes the formatting of displaying the percentages with the float precision of 2 and the percentage symbol "%%".
