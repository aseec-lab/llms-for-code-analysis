This code is a program that takes in two strings as input and determines whether they are anagrams of each other. 

The program begins with a function called "change" that takes in a character array as input. This function is used to sort the characters in the array in descending order. It does this by comparing adjacent characters and swapping them if the order is not correct. The function uses nested loops to check each pair of characters in the array and perform the swap if necessary.

In the main function, the program starts by declaring variables l1, l2, k, and i. 
- "l1" and "l2" are used to store the lengths of the input strings.
- "k" is a flag variable that is initially set to 0.
- "i" is used as a loop counter.

Next, the program uses the scanf function to take in two strings as input and store them in the character arrays "a" and "b" respectively.

The program then uses the strlen function to determine the lengths of the strings stored in "a" and "b" and assigns the values to "l1" and "l2" respectively.

The program then checks if the lengths of the two strings are equal using an if statement. If they are not equal, the program prints "NO" and exits. If they are equal, the program continues.

Next, the program calls the "change" function on both "a" and "b" to sort the characters in each array in descending order.

The program then enters a loop that iterates over each character in "a" and checks if it is equal to the corresponding character in "b". If any pair of characters are not equal, the variable "k" is set to 1.

After the loop, the program checks if "k" is equal to 0 using an if statement. If it is, it means that all characters were equal and the program prints "YES". If "k" is not equal to 0, it means that at least one pair of characters were not equal and the program prints "NO".
