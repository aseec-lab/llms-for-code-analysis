This code is a function called "Hint" that takes in several parameters and returns a value of type DSIZE. 

The purpose of this code is to perform some calculations on the input parameters and update the values of the "rect" array. It also determines the value of the "eflag" variable based on the results of the calculations. 

Let's go through the code step by step to understand what it does:

1. The code starts by declaring several variables of type DSIZE and ISIZE.

2. It sets the values of some elements in the "rect" array using the input parameters.

3. It initializes some variables and calculates the initial values of "sh" and "sl" based on the "rect" array.

4. It enters a for loop that runs "mcnt - 1" times or until "it" is greater than "iq". "mcnt" and "iq" are input parameters.

5. Inside the loop, it performs several calculations on the elements of the "rect" array and updates their values. These calculations involve dividing, adding, subtracting, and multiplying the values of different elements.

6. It calculates the values of "errio" and "errjo" using the updated values of the "rect" array.

7. It determines the values of "inc" and "jnc" based on the values of "errio" and "errjo".

8. It updates the values of the "errs" and "ixes" arrays based on the values of "inc" and "jnc".

9. It updates the value of "iq" based on whether "errs[iq + 2]" is equal to 0 or not.

10. It updates the values of "sl" and "sh" based on the updated values of the "rect" array.

11. After the loop, it checks whether "it" is greater than "iq" or not.

12. If "it" is greater than "iq", it sets the value of "eflag" to DISCRET.

13. If "it" is not greater than "iq", it sets the value of "eflag" to NOERROR.

14. Finally, it returns the value of "sh - sl".

The purpose of this code appears to be to perform some calculations and update the values of the "rect" array based on those calculations. The value of "eflag" is determined based on the outcome of the calculations.
