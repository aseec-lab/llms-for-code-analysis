The code declares an integer variable `n` and an array `a` of size 10000. 

The function `read()` reads three integers `n`, `i`, and `j` from the input using `scanf()`. Then, in a loop, it continues to read pairs of integers `i` and `j` until the sum `i+j` becomes 0. Inside the loop, it increments the value at index `j` of array `a` by one.

The `main()` function calls the `read()` function. Then, it iterates over `i` from 0 to `n-1` and checks if the value at index `i` of array `a` is equal to `n-1`. If it is, it prints the value of `i` using `printf()`. Finally, it returns 0.
