This code analyzes a string input character by character and determines if each character is part of a balanced parentheses pair. The code prints the input string and then prints a symbol for each character indicating whether it is an opening parentheses, closing parentheses, or neither.

The code starts with the declaration of an array `ch` of characters, an array `note` of integers, and two integer variables `l` and `r`.

The `while` loop reads input from the user until there are no more strings to read. Within this loop, the `memset` function is used to reset all elements of the `note` array to 0.

The next loop iterates through each character in the input string `ch`. Within this loop, a `switch` statement is used to handle three cases: '(' character, ')' character, and all other characters.

For '(' case:
 - The variables `l` and `r` are set to 0.
 - The `note` array element at index `i` is set to 1 to indicate an opening parentheses.
 - Another nested loop starts from the current index `i` and iterates through the string until the end.
 - Within this nested loop, another `switch` statement is used to handle two cases: '(' and ')' characters.
 - The variables `l` and `r` are incremented based on the encountered characters.
 - If `l` becomes equal to `r`, the loop is exited and the `note` array element at index `i` is set to 0 to indicate a balanced parentheses pair.
 
For ')' case:
 - Similar to the '(' case, the variables `l` and `r` are set to 0.
 - The `note` array element at index `i` is set to -1 to indicate a closing parentheses.
 - Another nested loop starts from the current index `i` and iterates towards the beginning of the string.
 - Within this nested loop, the variables `l` and `r` are incremented based on the encountered characters.
 - If `l` becomes equal to `r`, the loop is exited and the `note` array element at index `i` is set to 0 to indicate a balanced parentheses pair.

In both cases, any other characters encountered are ignored and the loop continues to the next character.

After analyzing the input string, the code prints the original string `ch` using `cout`. Then, a new loop iterates through each character in the string `ch` again and prints a symbol based on the value of the corresponding `note` array element.
 - If the `note` element is 1, '$' is printed to indicate an opening parentheses.
 - If the `note` element is -1, '?' is printed to indicate a closing parentheses.
 - If the `note` element is 0, ' ' (space) is printed to indicate a balanced parentheses pair.

Finally, a newline character is printed before the next iteration of the `while` loop.

The program returns 0 to indicate successful execution.
