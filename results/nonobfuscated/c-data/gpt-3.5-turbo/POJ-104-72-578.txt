The code provided is a program written in C. 

The main function begins by declaring several variables: `a` is a 2D array of size 21x21, `i`, `j`, `k`, `m`, and `n` are integers. 

The first nested for loop initializes all elements of the array `a` to 0.

The `scanf` function is used to read two integers `m` and `n` from standard input.

The next nested for loop is used to read integers from standard input and store them in the array `a`, starting from index (1,1) and continuing until index (m,n).

Finally, the last nested for loop iterates over the array `a` starting from index (1,1) up to index (m,n). It checks if the current element is greater than or equal to its four neighboring elements (above, left, below, and right). If it is, then it prints the coordinates of the current element (i-1, j-1) to standard output.

The code essentially finds all the local maxima in the `m`x`n` grid represented by the array `a` and prints their coordinates.
