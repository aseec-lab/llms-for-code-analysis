This code reads a string from the user, analyzes the string, and prints only the numbers found in the string. Each number is printed on a separate line.

Here is a breakdown of the code:

1. The main function is defined with a return type of int.
2. It declares several variables:
   - char c[50] to store the input string.
   - int end, i, l to control the loop.
3. The gets(c) function is used to read a string from the user and store it in the character array c.
4. The strlen(c) function is used to find the length of the input string and store it in the variable l.
5. The end variable is set to 1 initially.
6. A for loop is used to iterate through each character in the input string.
7. If the current character is a digit (0-9), it is printed using printf("%c",c[i]). The end variable is set to 0 since a number has been printed.
8. If the current character is not a digit and end is 0 (meaning a number was previously printed), a new line character ("\n") is printed using printf("\n"). The end variable is set back to 1 to indicate that no number is being printed currently.
9. After the loop is finished, the main function returns 0.

To summarize, this code takes a string input and extracts and prints only the numbers found in the string, each on a separate line.
