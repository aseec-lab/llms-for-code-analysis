This code takes user input as a string and counts the number of characters in each word. It then prints the count of each word followed by the total count of characters. 

Here is a breakdown of the code:

- The code begins with defining variables. "a" is a character array with size 1301, initialized with 0. "i" and "j" are integer variables used in the loops, "l" stores the length of the string, and "t" is the count of characters in each word.

- The gets() function is used to get user input and store it in the character array "a".

- The strlen() function is used to determine the length of the string "a", which is then stored in the variable "l".

- The for loop iterates through each character in the string. If the character is not a space (' '), the count "t" is increased by 1.

- If "t" is not 0 (meaning it is counting a word) and the current character is a space, the count "t" is printed followed by a comma.

- After the loop ends, the last word count "t" is printed without a comma. This represents the count of characters in the last word.

- Finally, the total count "t" is printed, which represents the count of characters in all words combined.

- The return 0 indicates successful execution of the program.
