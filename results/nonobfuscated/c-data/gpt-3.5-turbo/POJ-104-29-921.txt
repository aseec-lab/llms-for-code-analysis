The code is calculating and printing a series of numbers in a specific pattern. 
1. The code declares several variables including an array 'a' of size 1000 to store the calculated numbers, 'sum' and 'q' to store intermediate and final sums, 'b', 'c', 'd', 'j', 'k', 'l', 'n', and 'i' as indexing variables.
2. It assigns values to 'b' and 'c' as 2 and 1 respectively.
3. The code reads an integer 'n' from the user.
4. A loop starts from 0 and continues until 'n', in which the code reads 'n' integers from the user and stores them in the array 'd'.
5. Another loop starts from 0 and continues until 'n', in which the code calculates and prints the sum of a pattern of numbers.
    - In each iteration of this loop, the code initializes 'sum' as the first element of array 'a' (which is initially the division of 'b' by 'c').
    - It resets 'b' and 'c' to 2 and 1 respectively.
    - A nested loop starts from 1 and continues until the value at index 'i' of array 'd'.
        - In this nested loop, the code stores the value of 'b' in 'k', sets 'b' as the sum of 'b' and 'c', sets 'c' as the value of 'k', and calculates the division of 'b' by 'c' and stores it in the array 'a' at index 'j'.
        - The code adds the calculated value to 'sum'.
    - After the nested loop finishes, the code stores 'sum' in 'q' and prints 'q' with a precision of 3 decimal places.
6. The loop continues until all 'n' numbers are processed.
7. The code returns 0 to indicate successful execution of the program.
