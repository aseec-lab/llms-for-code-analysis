The given code takes a string as input using the gets function and stores it in a dynamically allocated memory space pointed to by the variable 'p'. It then calculates the length of the string using the strlen function and stores it in the variable 'n'.

Next, the code loops through the string starting from the last character (index n-1) and checks each character. If the character is not a space, the code continues to the next iteration of the loop. If the character is a space, the code enters a nested loop that starts from the next index (i+1) and prints each character until it encounters either a space or the end of the string (represented by '\0'). After printing the characters, it prints a space.

Finally, the code loops through the string again starting from the first character (index 0) and prints each character until it encounters either a space or the end of the string.

In summary, the code separates the string into words, reverses the order of the words, and prints them.
