This code takes in an integer input 'n' from the user and then an array 'a' of size 'n' is created to store 'n' integers. It then counts the number of odd integers in the array 'a' and stores it in 'd'. Another array 'b' of size 100 is created to store the odd integers from 'a'. 

The code then uses nested loops to fill up the array 'b' with the odd integers from 'a' in the same order as they appear in 'a'. Once 'b' is filled up, it sorts the array 'b' in ascending order using bubble sort algorithm. Finally, it prints the sorted array 'b' with a comma between each element.

The code then waits for another integer input from the user (presumably for the console window to stay open) and returns 0, indicating that the program has executed successfully.
