This code calculates the Grade Point Average (GPA) based on the user input. 

1. It first declares and initializes variables: n, a (array of size 10 to store input values), b (array of size 10 to store input grades), i, s (initialized as 0), c (array of size 10 to store corresponding GPAs), GPA, and t (initialized as 0).
2. It uses scanf to read the value of n from the user.
3. It then uses a for loop to read the values of a[i] from the user and calculates the sum of the input values in variable t.
4. Next, it uses another for loop to read the values of b[i] from the user and assigns the corresponding GPA values to c[i].
   - If the grade is between 90 and 100 inclusive, c[i] is assigned the value of 4.0.
   - If the grade is between 85 and 89 inclusive, c[i] is assigned the value of 3.7.
   - If the grade is between 82 and 84 inclusive, c[i] is assigned the value of 3.3.
   - If the grade is between 78 and 81 inclusive, c[i] is assigned the value of 3.0.
   - If the grade is between 75 and 77 inclusive, c[i] is assigned the value of 2.7.
   - If the grade is between 72 and 74 inclusive, c[i] is assigned the value of 2.3.
   - If the grade is between 68 and 71 inclusive, c[i] is assigned the value of 2.0.
   - If the grade is between 64 and 67 inclusive, c[i] is assigned the value of 1.5.
   - If the grade is between 60 and 63 inclusive, c[i] is assigned the value of 1.0.
   - If the grade is less than 60, c[i] is assigned the value of 0.
5. Finally, it uses another for loop to calculate the weighted sum of a[i] and c[i] in variable s. It then divides s by t to calculate the GPA and stores it in the variable GPA.
6. It uses printf to print the value of GPA with two decimal places.
7. The main function ends by returning 0.
