This code accepts user input for the dimensions of a 2D array and then populates it with values entered by the user. 

Here is a step-by-step breakdown of the code:

1. Declare and initialize variables: 
   - `i`, `j`, `m`, and `n` are integers initialized to 0.
   - `a` is an integer initialized to 0.
   - `p` is a pointer to a 2D array of integers. It is declared but not yet assigned any memory.

2. Accept input for `m` and `n` using `scanf()`. These represent the number of rows and columns of the 2D array, respectively.

3. Allocate memory for the 2D array using `calloc()`. `calloc(10000, 10000)` allocates memory for a 2D array of 10,000 rows and 10,000 columns. The `p` pointer is then cast to a pointer to this array.

4. Use nested for loops to accept user input for each element of the 2D array. The values entered by the user are stored in the memory allocated for the array.

5. Reset the values of `i` and `j` to 0.

6. Enter a while loop that will iterate `n+m-1` times.

7. Within the while loop, enter another while loop that executes until `i` is not equal to `m` and `j` is not equal to -1.

8. Print the value of the current element of the 2D array using `printf()`. The element is accessed using the `p` pointer and indices `i` and `j`.

9. Increment `i` and decrement `j`.

10. Increment `a`.

11. Check if `a` is greater than `n-1`. If true, set `j` to `n-1` and calculate the new value of `i` as `a` minus `(n-1)`. This ensures that `i` starts from the correct position in the next iteration of the loop.

12. Check if `a` is less than or equal to `n-1`. If true, set `j` to `a` and set `i` to 0. This ensures that `j` starts from the correct position in the next iteration of the loop.

13. Repeat the while loop until all iterations are complete.

Overall, this code creates a 2D array based on user input and then prints its elements in a specific pattern. The pattern starts from the top-right element and moves diagonally towards the bottom-left corner.
