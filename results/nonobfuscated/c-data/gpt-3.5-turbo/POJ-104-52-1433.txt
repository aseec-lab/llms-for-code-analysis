This code reads two integers n and m from the user and then scans n integers into an array a[]. 

Then, a for loop iterates from i=1 to i<=n, scanning the n integers into the array a[].

Next, another for loop iterates from i=n+1 to i<=n+n-m. Inside this loop, the values from a[1] to a[n] are duplicated and stored in a[n+1] to a[n+n-m].

After that, a third for loop iterates from i=n-m+1 to i<n+n-m. Inside this loop, the integers stored in a[] starting from a[n-m+1] up to a[n+n-m-1] are printed.

Finally, outside the loop, the last element a[i] is printed.

In summary, this code takes two integers n and m as input, reads n integers into an array a[], duplicates the values from a[] and stores them in a different part of the array, and prints the last m elements of the array a[].
