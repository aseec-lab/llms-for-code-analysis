This code takes an integer input 'n', then takes 'n' number of inputs from the user and stores them in an array 'a'. 

The code then checks for duplicates in the array 'a'. It iterates through each element in 'a' (excluding 0) and compares it with all the subsequent elements. If a duplicate is found, the duplicate element is set to 0.

Finally, the code loops through the elements of 'a' and prints the non-zero elements with commas separating them.
