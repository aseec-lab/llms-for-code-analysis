This code is a C++ program that takes an integer value "n" as input, followed by an array of "n" integers. It then reverses the order of the elements in the array and outputs the reversed array.

Here is a step-by-step analysis of the code:

1. The main function is declared, indicating the starting point of the program.
2. Several variables are declared and initialized:
   - "n" is an integer variable initialized to 0, which will store the number of elements in the array.
   - "i" and "j" are integer variables initialized to 0, which will be used as iterators for the loops.
   - "t" is an integer variable initialized to 0, which will be used as a temporary variable to store values during swapping.
3. The value of "n" is read from the user (input).
4. An array "a" of size 100000 is declared to store the input values.
5. A loop is started to read "n" elements from the user (input) and store them in the array "a".
6. Another loop is started to reverse the order of the elements in the array. The loop iterates from the beginning of the array (i = 0) to the middle (j = n-1), swapping corresponding elements each time. This is done by using the temporary variable "t" to temporarily store the value of "a[i]", then assigning "a[j]" to "a[i]" and "t" to "a[j]".
7. A loop is started to output the reversed array. It iterates from the beginning of the array (i = 0) to the second-to-last element (i = n-1). Each element is printed followed by a space character.
8. Finally, the last element of the reversed array is printed without a space character.
9. The main function returns 0, indicating a successful execution of the program.
