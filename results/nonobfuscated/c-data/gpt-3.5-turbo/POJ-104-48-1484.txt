The code is written in the C programming language and it calculates the values of a multi-dimensional array called "a". 

First, the code declares several variables, including "i", "j", "m", "n", and "d". It then uses the scanf() function to read in the values of "m" and "n" from the user.

Next, the code declares a three-dimensional array called "a" with dimensions [11][11][6]. All the elements in this array are initially set to 0 using nested for loops.

After that, the code sets the value of a specific element in "a" to the value of "m". This element is located at the coordinates [5][5][0].

Then, there is another set of nested for loops that iterates from d = 1 to d = n. Within these loops, the code calculates the values of the elements in "a" based on the values of the previous iteration's elements and stores them in the current iteration's elements.

Finally, there is a set of nested for loops that iterates through the elements in "a" and prints them out using the printf() function. The result is a grid of numbers representing the values of "a" at the specified coordinates.

The two getchar() functions at the end of the code are used to wait for user input before the program exits.
