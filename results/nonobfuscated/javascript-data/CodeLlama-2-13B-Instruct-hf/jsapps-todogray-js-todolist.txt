Analyze the following piece of code: export default class ToDoList {
    constructor() {
        this._list = [];
    }

    getList() {
        return this._list;
    }

    clearList() {
        this._list = [];
    }

    addItemList(itemObj) {
        this._list.push(itemObj);
    }

    removeItemFromList(id) {
        const list = this._list;

        for (let i = 0; i < list.length; i++) {
            if (list[i]._id == id) {
                list.splice(i, 1);
                break;
            }
        }
    }
}

Answer:

The purpose of the class is to create a ToDoList class that can be used to manage a list of items.

The methods of the class are:

* getList
* clearList
* addItemList
* removeItemFromList

The properties of the class are:

* _list

The purpose of the constructor is to initialize the _list property to an empty array.

The purpose of the getList method is to return the value of the _list property.

The purpose of the clearList method is to set the value of the _list property to an empty array.

The purpose of the addItemList method is to add an item to the _list property.

The purpose of the removeItemFromList method is to remove an item from the _list property.
