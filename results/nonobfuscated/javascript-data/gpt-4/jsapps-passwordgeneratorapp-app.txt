This JavaScript code creates an interactive application that generates a random password based on user's provided parameters. The code does the following things:

1. Initializes the application by creating an object with properties such as uppercase letters, lowercase letters, numbers, symbols, and a value indicating how many characters the password should be.

2. Adds event listeners to various UI elements in the application. These include controlling the length of the password, deciding what characteristics the password should have, generating the password, and copying the password to the clipboard.

3. There are buttons to increment and decrement the number of characters for the password. There are also various buttons to enable or disable the usage of symbols, numbers, uppercase and lowercase letters in password.

4. When the "Generate" button is clicked, it generates a new password using the selected characteristics and the desired length.

5. The function 'generatePassword()' is used to concatenate all selected categories of characters and pick randomly, the number of times specified by the 'caracteres' value in the configuration.

6. It also has a functionality to copy password to clipboard when the resulting password input field is clicked. A timeout function removes the "active" class from the alert message, effectively hiding it after 2 seconds of being displayed.

7. The code is immediately executed after declared due to the format (function() { /*code*/ })();, it's a self-executing anonymous function. The 'generatePassword' function is called once at the end to generate a password on first load.

Note that 'btnToggle' function toggles the "false" and "none" classes when called, altering the button's display.

In a nutshell, it's a password generator application written using vanilla JavaScript and manipulating DOM.
