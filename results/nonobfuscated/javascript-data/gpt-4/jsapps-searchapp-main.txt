This JavaScript code appears to be for a search bar function for a website. The functionality includes entering a search term, clearing the search text, retrieving search results, and displaying the statistics for the search results. 

The code imports various functions from three different JavaScript modules: `search-bar.js`, `data-functions.js`, and `search-results.js`.

- `search-bar.js` seems to handle the visual functionality of the search bar, such as focusing on the search field (`setSearchFocus`), controlling the visibility of the 'clear text' button (`showClearTextButton`), and the actual clearing of the search text (`clearSearchText`). 

- `data-functions.js` appears to manage data retrieval for the search bar, like getting the current search term (`getSearchTerm`) and retrieving the search results from some database or API (`retrieveSearchResults`).

- `search-results.js` seems to handle operations related to the search results, such as deleting previous search results (`deleteSearchResults`), building (rendering) the new search results (`buildSearchResults`), clearing and setting statistics line, which is likely to show how many search results were found (`clearStatsLine` and `setStatsLine`).

The event listeners added to the different elements watch for various user interactions such as typing in the search bar, clicking the clear button or trying to submit the search form, and then call the imported functions accordingly. 

The `readystatechange` event is fired when the ready state of the document changes and it calls the `initApp` function to set up the search bar when the document's state is "complete", meaning it has fully loaded.

The `processSearch` function is an asynchronous function which retrieves search results based on the search term and updates the user interface with the search results.

`submitSearch` function is called when the user submits the search form. It prevents the form's default submission behavior, deletes old search results, triggers the search process, and focuses on the search bar again.
