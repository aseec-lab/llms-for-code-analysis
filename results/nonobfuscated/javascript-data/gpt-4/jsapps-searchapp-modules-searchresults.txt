The provided code appears to be written in JavaScript and utilizes the Document Object Model (DOM) methods for HTML manipulation and event handling. It declares and exports a few functions related to the generation, display, and clear of search results in a website.

**deleteSearchResults()**: This function gets the element with the ID "search-results", and then removes all of its child elements.

**buildSearchResults(resultArray)**: This function takes an array of results as input. It logs the input array to the console, and then iterates over it. For each result, a new DOM element is created to hold the result. If the result has an image, an image element is created and appended. It generates a text result as well. Finally, all these created elements are appended to the element with ID "search-results".

**createResultItem(result)**: This helper function creates a new DOM element for a single result. This element includes a title which is a link that, when clicked, leads the user to the Wikipedia page associated with the result.

**createResultImage(result)**: Another helper function that creates an image element for a result if there's an image associated with the result.

**createResultText(result)**: This helper function creates the text element for the result.

**clearStatsLine()**: This function clears the text content of the "stats" element.

**setStatsLine(numberOfResults)**: This function updates the "stats" element to display the number of search results. If there are 0 results, it displays "No Results".
