The provided code is written in JavaScript and defines a class "ToDoItem" which is a model for a to-do list item.

This class has two properties (both initially set to null):
1. _id : a placeholder for a unique identifier of a to-do item.
2. _item : a placeholder for the actual to-do list item itself (the task to be done).

The class also includes four methods:
1. getId() : returns the ID of the to-do item.
2. setId(id) : sets the ID of the to-do item.
3. getItem() : returns the actual to-do list item.
4. setItem(item) : sets or updates the actual to-do list item.

Altogether, this class could be part of a larger to-do application that manages and manipulates to-do items. This class specifically would be used to create to-do list item objects with unique identifiers and tasks.
