This JavaScript code is for a simple "Rock, Paper, Scissors" game against a computer. 

Here's an overview of the game:

1. Players start the game by clicking on a button.
2. The gameplay is as follows: the player chooses either rock, paper, or scissors, and the computer randomly selects one of these options.
3. The player's and computer's choices are compared. According to the rules of Rock, Paper, Scissors, one of them wins the round and their score is incremented. In case of a tie, no one's score is incremented.
4. The scores of the player and the computer are updated on the screen after each round.

Here's a breakdown of some of the code:

- `startGame`: This function starts the game when the player clicks the button.
- `playMatch`: This function runs when a round starts. It binds click events to options (rock, paper, scissors). When the player clicks an option, the computer randomly selects an option. Then, they animate the hands (probably a shaking animation before revealing the chosen option), and after a delay of 2 seconds, the chosen options are compared.
- `compareHands`: This function takes in the player's choice and the computer's choice as arguments, compares them, and determines who wins the round. It also increments the winner's score.
- `updateScore`: This function updates the scores on the screen.
- `game`: It's the main function that initializes and starts the game. 

The game continues in this loop until the player decides to quit.
