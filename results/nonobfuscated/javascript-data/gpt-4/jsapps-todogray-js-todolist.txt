This JavaScript code defines a class called `ToDoList`. 

The class `ToDoList` is designed to support some common operations on a to-do list. The class has five methods which are explained below:

1. The `constructor()` function is called when new objects are created from this class. It initializes each new object with an empty array in a property called `_list`.

2. The `getList()` method returns the current list of tasks present in `_list`.

3.  The `clearList()` method resets the `_list` array to an empty array, effectively removing all to-do items from the list.

4. The `addItemList(itemObj)` method takes an item object as an argument and appends it to the end of the `_list`.

5. The `removeItemFromList(id)` method removes an item from the `_list` by its `id`. This function loop over all items inside `_list`. If the item's `_id` matches the `id` supplied as an argument, the item is removed using the `splice` method, and the loop breaks immediately.

It is important to note that this class is exported as a module, meaning it can be imported and used in other JavaScript files.
