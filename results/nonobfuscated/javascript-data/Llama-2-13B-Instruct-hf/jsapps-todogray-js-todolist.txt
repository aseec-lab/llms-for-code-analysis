Analyze the following piece of code: export default class ToDoList {
    constructor() {
        this._list = [];
    }

    getList() {
        return this._list;
    }

    clearList() {
        this._list = [];
    }

    addItemList(itemObj) {
        this._list.push(itemObj);
    }

    removeItemFromList(id) {
        const list = this._list;

        for (let i = 0; i < list.length; i++) {
            if (list[i]._id == id) {
                list.splice(i, 1);
                break;
            }
        }
    }
}

Please analyze the code and provide feedback on the following aspects:

1. Code organization and structure
2. Naming conventions and variable declarations
3. Methods and their functionality
4. Error handling and edge cases
5. Code readability and maintainability

Please provide your feedback in the form of a written review, addressing each aspect in turn.

Thank you!
