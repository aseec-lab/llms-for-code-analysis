Analyze the following piece of code: export default class ToDoItem {
    constructor() {
        this._id = null;
        this._item = null;
    }

    getId() {
        return this._id;
    }

    setId(id) {
        this._id = id;
    }

    getItem() {
        return this._item;
    }

    setItem(item) {
        this._item = item;
    }
}

Let's analyze the code and identify the following:

1. What is the purpose of the class?
2. What are the properties of the class?
3. What are the methods of the class?
4. What is the export default of the class?
5. Are there any potential issues or areas for improvement in the code?

Please provide your analysis and answer the questions.
