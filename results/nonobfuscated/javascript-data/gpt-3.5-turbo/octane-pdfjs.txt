This code is for a PDF viewer using the PdfJS library. 

The code initializes some variables and sets up the PdfJS benchmark suite. The `pdf_file` variable stores the name of the PDF file to be loaded. The `canvas_logs` array will store logs of canvas operations. The `PdfJS` benchmark suite is created with one benchmark called "PdfJS". 

The `setupPdfJS` function is called before running the benchmark. It checks if the required array types are supported and throws an error if not. It then adds the PDF file to the `__resources__` object in the `PdfJS_window`. 

The `runPdfJS` function is the main function that runs the benchmark. It gets a PDF document using the `getDocument` method of `PDFJS`, and then retrieves the canvas element and its context from the HTML document. It creates a `renderContext` object for rendering the pages of the PDF. It pushes the context's log to the `canvas_logs` array. 

The `renderPages` function is a recursive function that iterates through the pages of the PDF and renders them on the canvas. It first clears the canvas, then gets a page from the PDF and sets the viewport and size of the canvas based on the page's dimensions. It then renders the page using the `renderContext` and recursively calls itself with the next page number. 

After rendering all the pages, the `tearDownPdfJS` function is called. It iterates through the `canvas_logs` array and checks the length and hash of each log against expected values. If any log does not match, an error is thrown. Finally, the `PDFJS` and `PdfJS_window` objects are deleted. 

The `buffer` function converts a string to an `ArrayBuffer` object by creating a Uint8Array and filling it with the ASCII codes of the characters in the string. 

The `hash` function calculates a numerical hash value for a string using a rolling hash algorithm. 

The code then creates the `PdfJS_window` object as a clone of the global `this` object. It adds some properties and methods to the `PdfJS_window` object, including `setTimeout`, `flushTimeouts`, and `window`. It also defines the `btoa` and `atob` functions for base64 encoding and decoding. 

The `__to64__` and `__from64__` arrays are used for base64 encoding and decoding. 

Overall, this code sets up the PdfJS library, runs a benchmark to render a PDF on a canvas, and provides additional utility functions for base64 encoding and decoding.This code continues the implementation of the `Context` class for logging canvas operations.
