This code is part of a web application and is responsible for handling the search functionality. 

1. The code includes several modules that are imported using the `import` statement.
2. The `document.addEventListener("readystatechange", (event) => {...})` block listens for the `readystatechange` event and executes the `initApp()` function when the `readyState` is "complete". This ensures that the app initializes only when all the resources have finished loading.
3. The `initApp()` function is called to initialize the app. It sets the focus on the search input field, adds an event listener to show the clear text button when the search input receives input, and adds event listeners to the clear button to clear the search text and handle keyboard interactions.
4. The `submitSearch()` function is called when the search form is submitted. It prevents the default form submission behavior, deletes any existing search results, processes the search by calling the `processSearch()` function, and sets the focus back on the search input field.
5. The `processSearch()` function is an asynchronous function that processes the search. It clears the stats line, retrieves the search term from the input field, and checks if the search term is empty. If the search term is empty, the function returns and does nothing else. If the search term is not empty, it calls the `retrieveSearchResults()` function to retrieve the search results using the search term. It then checks if the `resultArray` has any results and if so, it calls the `buildSearchResults()` function to build and display the search results. Finally, it calls the `setStatsLine()` function to update the stats line with the number of search results.
