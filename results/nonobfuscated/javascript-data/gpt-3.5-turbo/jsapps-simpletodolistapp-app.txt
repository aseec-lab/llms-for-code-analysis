This code is written in JavaScript and it appears to handle a todo list application. 

Here is a breakdown of what the code does:

1. It starts by selecting three HTML elements using their respective IDs and assigns them to variables:
   - `todoForm` represents the form element with the ID "todoForm".
   - `todoInput` represents the input element with the ID "todoInput".
   - `itemList` represents the unordered list element with the ID "itemList".

2. It then adds an event listener to the `todoForm` element for the "submit" event. When the form is submitted, the event listener function is executed.

3. The event listener function begins by preventing the default behavior of form submission, which is to refresh the page.

4. It checks if the value of `todoInput` is an empty string. If it is empty, the `inputoEmpty()` function is called and the function execution is stopped using `return false`.

5. If the `todoInput` is not empty, the `addItem()` function is called with the value of `todoInput` as an argument.

6. The `inputoEmpty()` function simply logs the string "empty" to the console.

7. The `addItem()` function takes an item as a parameter. It creates an HTML string (`listItem`) using a template literal. This string represents a list item with the value of the `item` parameter and a button with an "onclick" attribute calling the `removeItem()` function, passing it `this` as an argument. The `this` keyword refers to the button element that was clicked.

8. The `insertAdjacentHTML()` method is called on the `list` element, appending the `listItem` string after the beginning of its contents.

9. After adding the item to the list, the `todoInput` value is cleared and focused for the user to enter the next item.

10. The `removeItem()` function is defined, which takes `itemToDelete` as a parameter. It removes the parent element (the list item) of the `itemToDelete` button that was clicked.

Overall, this code sets up event handlers for the form submission, handles adding items to the todo list, and provides functionality to remove items from the list.
