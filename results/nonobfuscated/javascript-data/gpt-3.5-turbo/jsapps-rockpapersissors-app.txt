The code defines a game of rock-paper-scissors. 

1. The game function is defined, which sets the initial scores for the player (pScore) and computer (cScore).
2. The startGame function is defined. It selects elements from the document (introScreen, playBtn, and match) and adds an event listener to the playBtn. When clicked, it adds the "fadeOut" class to introScreen and the "fadeIn" class to match, causing a fade-out effect for the intro screen and a fade-in effect for the match screen.
3. The playMatch function is defined. It selects elements from the document (computerHand, playerHand, options) and adds event listeners to each option. When an option is clicked, it generates a random computer choice (rock, paper, or scissors), updates the player and computer hands with the corresponding images, and starts an animation (shakePlayer and shakeComputer) for the hands. After a delay of 2000 milliseconds, it calls the compareHands function to determine the winner.
4. The compareHands function compares the player's choice and the computer's choice to determine the winner. If they choose the same option, it declares a tie. If the player chooses rock and the computer chooses scissors, or the player chooses paper and the computer chooses rock, or the player chooses scissors and the computer chooses paper, the player wins and the player's score is incremented. Otherwise, the computer wins and the computer's score is incremented. The function also calls the updateScore function to update the score display.
5. The updateScore function updates the player and computer score elements in the document with the current scores.
6. The startGame and playMatch functions are called to start the game.
7. The game function is called to execute the game logic.
