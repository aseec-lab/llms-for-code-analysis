This code sets up an event listener for a button with the id "boton". When the button is clicked, it calls the function "traerDatos".

The "traerDatos" function creates an instance of the XMLHttpRequest object and sends a GET request to a file called "ajax-text.txt". It sets the asynchronous parameter to true. 

The XMLHttpRequest object has an onreadystatechange event handler that checks if the readyState is 4 (complete) and the status is 200 (OK). If so, it logs the response text to the console and sets the innerHTML of an element with the id "respuesta" to the response text.
