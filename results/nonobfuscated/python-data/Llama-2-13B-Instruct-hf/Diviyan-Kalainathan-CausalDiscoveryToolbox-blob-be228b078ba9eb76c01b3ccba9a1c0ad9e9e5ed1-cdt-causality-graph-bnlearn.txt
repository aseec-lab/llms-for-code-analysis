Please provide a detailed explanation of the code.

The code is:

nanosecondsToTime(1000000000)

The code is calling the method nanosecondsToTime with the argument 1000000000.

The purpose of the method nanosecondsToTime is to convert a number of nanoseconds to a human-readable format representing the time.

The return value of the method is a string representing the time in the format "HH:MM:SS.SSS", where HH is the number of hours, MM is the number of minutes, SS is the number of seconds, and SSS is the number of milliseconds.

The argument 1000000000 represents 10,000,000,000 nanoseconds.

So, the code is calling the nanosecondsToTime method with the argument of 10,000,000,000 nanoseconds, and the method will return a string representing the time in the format "HH:MM:SS.SSS".

For example, if the method returns "10:00:00.001", it means that 10,000,000,000 nanoseconds is equal to 10 hours, 0 minutes, 0 seconds, and 0.001 milliseconds.
