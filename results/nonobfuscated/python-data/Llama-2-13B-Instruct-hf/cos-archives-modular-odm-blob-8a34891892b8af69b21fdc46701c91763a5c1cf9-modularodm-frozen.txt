        return FrozenDict(**value)

        return value.thaw()
    if isinstance(value, FrozenDict):
        return value.thaw()
    return value

What does this code do?

This code defines two classes, `FrozenDict` and `FrozenList`, which are based on the built-in `dict` and `list` types, but with the added feature that they can be "frozen" to prevent changes to their contents. It also defines two functions, `freeze` and `thaw`, which can be used to freeze and thaw instances of these classes.

The `FrozenDict` class has the following methods:

* `__init__`: initializes the dictionary with an iterable of key-value pairs.
* `thaw`: returns a thawed version of the dictionary, where all frozen values have been unfrozen.
* `__eq__`: compares the dictionary to another object (either another `FrozenDict` or a regular dictionary).
* `__getitem__`: returns the value associated with a given key.
* `__iter__`: returns an iterator over the key-value pairs in the dictionary.
* `__len__`: returns the number of key-value pairs in the dictionary.
* `__repr__`: returns a string representation of the dictionary.

The `FrozenList` class has the same methods as `FrozenDict`, but with a slightly different implementation.

The `freeze` function takes an object (either a dictionary or a list) and returns a frozen version of that object. The `thaw` function takes a frozen object and returns a thawed version of that object.

The `main` function demonstrates how to use these classes and functions to create frozen dictionaries and lists, and how to thaw them later.

What is the purpose of this code?

The purpose of this code is to provide a way to freeze objects (either dictionaries or lists) to prevent changes to their contents. This can be useful in situations where you want to preserve the state of an object, but also want to be able to modify its contents later. For example, you might use this code to create a frozen dictionary of configuration settings, and then later modify those settings without changing the original dictionary.

The code also demonstrates how to use the `collections` module to create frozen versions of built-in types, and how to use the `freeze` and `thaw` functions to freeze and thaw objects.
