This Python code provides several functions to generate random numbers following the pattern of account numbers, INN (Individual Taxpayer Number), OGRN (Primary State Registration Number), and BIK (Bank Identification Code) which are important for financial transactions and registration in Russia. 

The types for generating those numbers can either be for an individual person or a legal entity.

Below is what each function does:

1. `account_number()`: Generates a random 20-digit account number.

2. `bik()`: Generates a random Bank Identification Code.

3. `inn()`: Generates a random tax ID number(INN) based on the entity type, which can either be a 'person' or 'legal'. The default is 'legal'.

4. `legal_inn()`: Generates a legal entity random INN.

5. `legal_ogrn()`: Generates a legal entity OGRN.

6. `ogrn()`: Generates an OGRN based on the entity type, either 'person' or 'legal'. The default type is 'legal'.

7. `person_inn()`: Generates a personal INN.

8. `person_ogrn()`: Generates a personal OGRN.

The numbers generated by these methods, although random, adhere to certain rules which are followed while creating these financial identifiers in Russia. For instance, the last digit of INN or OGRN is a checksum controlling digit and is not random but calculated based on rest digits.
