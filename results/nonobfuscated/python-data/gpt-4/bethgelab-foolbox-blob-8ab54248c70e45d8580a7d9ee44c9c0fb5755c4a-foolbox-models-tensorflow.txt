The provided code defines a class, `TensorFlowModel`, which is a subclass of `DifferentiableModel` implementing the functionality of a machine learning model built with TensorFlow. This class provides a variety of methods for interacting with and evaluating the model.

Let's go through important parts of the code:

- The `__init__` method:
  Creates an instance of the `TensorFlowModel` class, initializing some core variables, setting up the TensorFlow session, and constructing the graph for forward (evaluation) and backward (gradient computation) pass of the model.

- The `from_keras` class method:
  This is a utility method to create a `TensorFlowModel` instance from a Keras model. It parses the Keras model and its inputs, prepares the logits and finally returns an instance of `TensorFlowModel`.

- The `num_classes` method:
  Returns the number of classes the model can classify the inputs into.

- The `predictions_and_gradient` method:
  Given an image and a label, it computes and returns the predictions and the gradient of the model for the image.

- The `__exit__` method:
  Closes the TensorFlow session when the `TensorFlowModel` object is garbage collected.

- The `backward` method: 
  Computes and returns the backward gradient of the input image. 

In a nutshell, the `TensorFlowModel` class encapsulates a TensorFlow graph and the associated operations for model evaluation, gradient calculations, and other utility functions. This can be used for executing forward and backward passes through a model for tasks such as evaluating the model's output for given inputs, computing gradients for backpropagation, among others.
