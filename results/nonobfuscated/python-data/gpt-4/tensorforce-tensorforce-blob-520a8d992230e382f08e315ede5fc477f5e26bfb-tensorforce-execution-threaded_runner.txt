The code in Python defines a multi-agent, multi-environment runner based on TensorForce, using threads for running agents/instances/threads in parallel. The runner is specifically targeted at deep reinforcement learning tasks. 

The class `ThreadedRunner` defines methods for initialization, closing, running and executing tasks in a single thread.

1. `def __init__(self, agent, environment, repeat_actions=1, save_path=None, save_episodes=None, save_frequency=None, save_frequency_unit=None, agents=None, environments=None)`: The initializer checks for deprecated parameters, checks if the number of agents and environments are the same, sets the path for saving the model, initializes locks, and variables.

2. `def close(self)`: Method for closing agents and environments.

3. `def run(self,num_episodes=-1,max_episode_timesteps=-1,episode_finished=None,summary_report=None,summary_interval=0,num_timesteps=None,deterministic=False,episodes=None,max_timesteps=None,testing=False,sleep=None)`: This function initiates the running process of the runner. It checks for deprecated parameters, resets variables, creates threads for individual agents, starts threads, and waits for them to finish.

4. `def _run_single(self, thread_id, agent, environment, deterministic=False, max_episode_timesteps=-1, episode_finished=None, testing=False, sleep=None)`: The function describes what a single thread does. This function executes a single agent's actions and observes the results in the environment. The actions are replicated according to `repeat_actions`. After each step, if the `episode_finished` callback is provided and returning `False`, the thread is stopped. 

The code uses Python's built-in `threading` library to use threads to let multiple agents play in parallel. The method `ThreadedRunner.run()` launches a thread for each agent-environment pair, where each thread runs the method `_run_single()`. The number of episodes to be run can either be predefined or infinite (if `-1` is passed as `num_episodes`). 

Updates, checks and reporting are done periodically according to intervals defined by `save_frequency`,`summary_report`, and `summary_interval`. The code handles keyboard interruption to safely stop the threads. 

The model is saved at specified intervals according to `save_frequency_unit`, which can be either `s` (seconds), `e` (episodes), or `t` (timesteps). 

This code is useful for running a large number of reinforcement learning simulations in parallel, with periodical saving of the models and sumaries of the results.The rest of the code is composed of some utility functions and class/property declarations.

1. `@property` methods: These define some 'getter' methods for accessing the values of certain instance attributes.
2. `def WorkerAgentGenerator(agent_class)`: A function to generate a new worker agent class that inherits from a provided agent class (either a string indicating the agent type or a class object itself). If the agent class name is provided as a string with '.' in it, it's considered as a module.classname and is imported accordingly.
    * `WorkerAgent` class that takes optionally a model object during initialization (which is used if `agent_class` is not a subclass of 'LearningAgent'), inherits from the given `agent_class` and has its own `initialize_model` method that simply returns the provided model during initialization.
3. `def clone_worker_agent(agent, factor, environment, network, agent_config)`: This function generates a list of agent objects. The first agent in the list is provided as an argument, and the remaining are generated by calling the `WorkerAgentGenerator` function. The attributes of these generated agents are set according to the arguments provided to `clone_worker_agent`.

It seems like this part of the code deals with dynamically creating and cloning agent classes based on given configurations. This can be useful for scenarios in which different types of reinforcement learning agents need to be tested under the same conditions for comparison purposes.
