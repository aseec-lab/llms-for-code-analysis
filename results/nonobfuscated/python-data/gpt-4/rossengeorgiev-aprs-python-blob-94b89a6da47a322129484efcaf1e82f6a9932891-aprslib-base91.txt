This Python code consists of a set of functions and checks related to converting text into decimal numbers and vice versa, based on certain coding standards and rules.

The primary functions are `to_decimal()` and `from_decimal()`.

`to_decimal(text)`: Takes a string input, verifies if the string contains any invalid character, strips leading '!', converts each character into its ordinal value, and converts that into a corresponding decimal number. The sum of all decimal numbers obtained this way, is returned.

`from_decimal(number, width=1)`: This function receives an integer and returns the equivalent string of characters for that number, according to the same encoding standard. It returns it as a string right-justified with '!' to fill the width.

The code has a requirement for python version and behaves accordingly. `_range` is assigned `xrange`, a function, for Python 2.x versions and to `range`, another function, for Python 3.x versions. This is to handle different Python version behaviours for the range generation.
