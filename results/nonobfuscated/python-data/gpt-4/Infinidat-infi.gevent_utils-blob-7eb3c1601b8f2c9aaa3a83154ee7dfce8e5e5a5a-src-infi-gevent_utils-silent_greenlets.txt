This code defines a system for handling exceptions while running functions in separate greenlets, lightweight concurrent primitives provided by the gevent library in python. The code wraps the function to be executed inside a greenlet where any exceptions are caught, logged, and then rethrown inside a special SilentGreenletExceptionWrapper. 

The spawn function wraps the caller's function with the exception handler and then spawns a greenlet with that function.

The join function waits for the greenlet to return a value and checks if it is an instance of SilentGreenletExceptionWrapper, i.e., an exception occurred in the greenlet. If it is, and if the raise_error flag is set to True, the original exception is re-raised. If raise_error is set to False, None is returned.

The joinall function waits for all greenlets to finish and then optionally checks and raises any exceptions they might have thrown if raise_error is set to True. If raise_error is False, it simply returns without checking or raising any exceptions.

Therefore, the main purpose of this code is to implement concurrency through greenlets, but with an additional level of control over exception handling.
