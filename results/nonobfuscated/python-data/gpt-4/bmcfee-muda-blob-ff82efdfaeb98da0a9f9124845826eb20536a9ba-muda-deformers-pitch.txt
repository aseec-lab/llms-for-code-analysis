The provided code is written in Python and it's responsible for shifting the pitch of audio files. It uses the libraries librosa and pyrubberband to manipulate audio data. 

Three types of pitch shift transformations are implemented: normal pitch shift, random pitch shift and linear pitch shift. 

1. `PitchShift` is a basic pitch shifting transformer which shifts the pitch of the audio by the given semitones.

2. `RandomPitchShift` is a random pitch shift transformer. It generates pitch shifts according to a normal distribution, with the mean and standard deviation provided by the user.

3. `LinearPitchShift` is a linear pitch shifting transformer. It generates linearly spaced pitch shifts between a lower and upper bound, and the total number of pitch shifts is also specified by the user.

In general, these classes can be used as part of an audio data augmentation pipeline in machine learning applications. They would potentially alter the pitch of audio files to increase the diversity of training data, which could help improve a model's ability to generalize from the training data to unseen data.
