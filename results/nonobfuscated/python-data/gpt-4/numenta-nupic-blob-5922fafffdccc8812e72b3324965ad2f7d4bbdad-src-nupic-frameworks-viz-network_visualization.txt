This Python code defines a class named 'NetworkVisualizer' used for visualizing networks. 

Upon initialization, the `NetworkVisualizer` objects require to be associated with a network for which the visualization is to be done.

The `export` method of the `NetworkVisualizer` class creates and returns a graph of the provided network using the 'networkx' library. The nodes of the graph represent 'regions' in the network and edges represent 'links' between regions. Links are directed hence graph is created as a MultiDiGraph, allowing for multiple directed edges between nodes.

The `getSrcRegionName`, `getDestRegionName`, `getSrcOutputName`, and `getDestInputName` are methods likely associated with the `link` object, returning source or destination details associated with the link.

Finally, the `render` method uses a renderer to visualize the exported graph. The renderer used defaults to 'DotRenderer' from 'nupic.frameworks.viz' if not explicitly provided.

Summing up, it's a class that generates and visualizes a directed graph using nodes, edges, and their relation from a certain network.
