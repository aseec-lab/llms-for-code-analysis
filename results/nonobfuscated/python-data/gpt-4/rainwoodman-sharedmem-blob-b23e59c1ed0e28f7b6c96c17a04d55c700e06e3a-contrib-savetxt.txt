This is a python program that provides extensive functionalities to save and load data with complex datatypes using numpy and some additional modules. The key functions include:
- `savetxt2`: This function saves the Numpy array to a text file. The parameters like the name of the file, the array itself, delimiter to be used, newline character, Comment character, header, and several other parameters can be passed into this function. It uses functions like `_mkheader`, `_mkfmtstr`to create the header and format the data accordingly.
- `loadtxt2`: This function loads data from a text file into a Numpy array. It allows to select the data type of the array, delimiter for splitting lines, newline character, comment character, and number of the lines that are skipped from the start of the file.
- `test`: This function tests the above two functions with some sample data.
- The other functions namely `_mkheader`, `_mkfmtstr`, `_mkvalrow`, `_psvalrow`, `simplerepr`, `flatten_dtype` provide helper functionalities that make it easier to handle complex data type operations.

Finally, there's a conditional that checks if the file is being run directly; if it is, it runs the `test` function. This is a common pattern in Python for scripts that are also designed to be imported as modules.
