The provided code is used to create a TCP listener in Python. The TCPListener class, which inherits from IOHandler, is using a socket framework to listen to incoming TCP connections. Here is a detailed breakdown of the functions used in the class:

- `__init__(self, family, address, target)`: Constructor of the class that initiates a socket with a given address, sets reusing of address socket option, binds the socket to the given address, and sets target (a callback function that handles accepted connections).

- `__del__(self)`: Destructor of the class that closes the open socket.

- `close(self)`: Method to explicitly close the open socket with proper thread safety using a lock.

- `prepare(self)`: This function makes the listener socket start listening for connections. The maximum connection queue (`SOMAXCONN`) is set to the system maximum. Also, the blocking mode of the socket is set to non-blocking.

- `fileno(self)`: This function returns the file descriptor of the socket.

- `is_readable(self)` and `wait_for_readability(self)`: These functions check if the socket is readable which means it has a new connection request.

- `is_writable(self)` and `wait_for_writability(self)`: These functions are always returning False as a listener socket is not used to send data, so it doesn't have to be writable.

- `handle_write(self)`: This function is empty because a listener socket does not need to handle write events.

- `handle_read(self)`: This function handles the reading from the socket which is checking for new connections and when a new connection is accepted, it's handing it over to the `target` function set in the constructor.

- `handle_hup(self)`, `handle_err(self)`, `handle_nval(self)`: These functions handle hangup, error, and invalid file descriptor events respectively on the socket by closing the socket and throwing an exception for error and invalid file descriptor. 

In conclusion, this class can be used to create a TCP server that listens to a certain port number for incoming connections, accepts them, and sends them to a designated function to handle the communication with the client.
