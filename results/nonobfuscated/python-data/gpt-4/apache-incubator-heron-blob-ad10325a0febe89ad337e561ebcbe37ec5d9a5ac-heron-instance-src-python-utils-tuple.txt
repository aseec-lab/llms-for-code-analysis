The provided Python code is largely dedicated to the creation, manipulation, and expiry checking of Tuples. Tuples are an immutable, hashable data structure in Python that can hold an ordered collection of elements. This code seems to be from the Heron project, a real-time, distributed, fault-tolerant stream processing engine.

- The `namedtuple` function from the `collections` module is used to create two new classes of Tuples - "HeronTuple" and "RootTupleInfo".

- "HeronTuple" extends the existing Tuple class from the "heronpy" library, adding two new fields - 'creation_time' and 'roots'.

- A new class "RootTupleInfo" is also created, which has methods to check if the tuple is expired based on current time and a specified timeout.

- The "TupleHelper" class provides utilities for creating these Tuples and working with them. This class uses Python static methods that can be called on the class itself without any instances.

- The `make_tuple` method in "TupleHelper" generates a new "HeronTuple" from provided data, and assigns a random key if "roots" is not provided.

- The `make_tick_tuple` method creates a special kind of "HeronTuple" known as a tick tuple. Tick tuples are typically used in stream processing as a way to trigger certain actions at regular intervals.

- The `make_root_tuple_info` method creates a new "RootTupleInfo" with a random key. The "RootTupleInfo" keeps track of the stream ID and the tuple ID, along with the time of insertion. This seems useful for determining the "roots" of a tuple in a complex stream processing graph.
