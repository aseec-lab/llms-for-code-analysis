The given code appears to be a Python class called Locations, which is a subclass of WhenIWork. This class is used to manage "locations" in the application, specifically regarding the retrieval of data related to individual locations or to a collection of locations.

1. `get_location(self, location_id)`: This method is used to get information about a particular location given its location_id. It formulates the URL using the provided location_id, retrieves the corresponding data, and formats it by calling location_from_json() method before returning it.

2. `get_locations(self)`: This method is used to fetch data of all available locations. It formulates the URL, retrieves the data, then iterates through each entry in the received data, converts it using location_from_json(), and adds it to the 'locations' list which is then returned.

3. `location_from_json(data)`: This is a static method, which means it can be called on the class itself rather than an instance of it. It is used to format the JSON data into a location object, then sets its properties (location_id, name, address) based on the data.

The 'Location' being mentioned here might be a logical or a physical location in the context of the larger application and is probably an important entity. The 'WhenIWork' class is likely to contain methods used for making API calls, in this case "_get_resource(url)".
