The code is a Python implementation of a server that can handle HTTP requests. It uses the WsgiDAV library to provide support for WebDAV access on top of the HTTP server.

The code is split into several parts:

1. Import statements: These import the necessary modules and classes from the WsgiDAV library, as well as other standard Python libraries.

2. Class `ExtHandler`: This class is a subclass of `BaseHTTPServer.BaseHTTPRequestHandler` and is responsible for handling HTTP requests.

3. Class `ExtServer`: This class is a subclass of `BaseHTTPServer.HTTPServer` and is responsible for creating and starting the HTTP server.

4. Function `serve`: This function is used to start the server. It takes a configuration dictionary and an application object as parameters and creates an instance of `ExtServer` to handle the requests.

The main functionality of the server is implemented in the `ExtHandler` class. It overrides several methods from the base class to customize the behavior:

- `do_method`: This method is called when a request is received. It determines the appropriate WSGI application to handle the request based on the path of the URL and calls the `runWSGIApp` method to run the application and handle the response.

- `runWSGIApp`: This method sets up the environment for the WSGI application, including the request method, path, query string, and headers. It then calls the application with the environment and a callback function (`wsgiStartResponse`) to handle the response. The response data is written to the client connection.

- `wsgiStartResponse`: This method is called by the WSGI application to set the response status and headers. It saves the status and headers in the `wsgiHeaders` attribute and returns a callback function (`wsgiWriteData`) to write the response data.

- `wsgiWriteData`: This method writes the response data to the client connection. It first sends the response headers if they haven't been sent yet, and then writes the data to the connection.

The `ExtServer` class extends the `BaseHTTPServer.HTTPServer` class and adds some additional functionality:

- `handle_error`: This method is called when an error occurs while processing a request. It logs the error and prints a traceback.

- `stop_serve_forever`: This method is used to stop the server from running. It sends a shutdown request to the server itself and waits for it to stop.

- `serve_forever_stoppable`: This method is similar to `serve_forever` from the base class but can be stopped by calling `stop_serve_forever`.

The `serve` function is used to start the server. It takes a configuration dictionary and an application object as parameters and creates an instance of `ExtServer` to handle the requests. It also logs some information about the server and starts serving forever.The code checks if the current module is being run as the main module (`__name__ == "__main__"`). If it is, it raises a `RuntimeError` with the message "Use run_server.py".

This is a safety measure to prevent the server from being run directly from this module. Instead, the server should be started using the "run_server.py" script, which sets up the necessary configuration and calls the `serve` function.

By raising a `RuntimeError`, the code ensures that if someone accidentally tries to run this module directly, an error will be raised and the server won't start.
