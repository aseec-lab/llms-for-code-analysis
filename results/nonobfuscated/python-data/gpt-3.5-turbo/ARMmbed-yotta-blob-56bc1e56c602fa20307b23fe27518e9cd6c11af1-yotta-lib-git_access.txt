This code is for a Git-based version control system. It includes several classes and functions for working with Git repositories.

- The `GitCloneVersion` class is a subclass of the `version.Version` class. It represents a specific version of a Git repository that can be cloned and unpacked into a directory. It has a `unpackInto` method that clones the Git repository and removes the working copy after unpacking.

- The `GitWorkingCopy` class represents a working copy of a Git repository. It has methods for removing the working copy, getting the available versions, tags, and branches of the repository, getting the tip version, and committing a version based on a specific commit or tag.

- The `GitComponent` class is a subclass of the `access_common.RemoteComponent` class. It represents a Git component with a specific URL and version/tag/branch specification. It has methods for creating a Git component from a source, getting the version specification, getting the tag or branch specification, and cloning the Git repository.

- The `remoteType` method is a class method of the `GitComponent` class that returns the type of the remote repository, which is 'git'.

Overall, this code provides a way to work with Git repositories and clone them into a directory. It also allows for getting information about available versions, tags, and branches of a Git repository.
