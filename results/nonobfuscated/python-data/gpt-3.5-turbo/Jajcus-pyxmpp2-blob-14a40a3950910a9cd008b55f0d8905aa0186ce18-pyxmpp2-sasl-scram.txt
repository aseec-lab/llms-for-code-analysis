The code is a Python implementation of the SCRAM (Salted Challenge Response Authentication Mechanism) protocol. SCRAM is a type of authentication protocol used in secure messaging systems. The code provides functionality for both the client and server sides of the authentication process.

Here is a summary of the functionality provided by the code:

- In the `SCRAMOperations` class, there are several helper functions for handling various cryptographic operations required by the SCRAM protocol, such as hashing and generating random nonces.

- The `SCRAMClientAuthenticator` class implements the client side of the SCRAM authentication process. It provides methods for generating the initial client message, handling server challenges, and verifying the final server response.

- The `SCRAMServerAuthenticator` class implements the server side of the SCRAM authentication process. It provides methods for verifying the client messages and generating the server challenges and response.

The code implements the SCRAM authentication protocol according to the specifications defined in the RFC 5802 and RFC 7677 documents.The remaining part of the code defines four subclasses: `SCRAM_SHA_1_ClientAuthenticator`, `SCRAM_SHA_1_PLUS_ClientAuthenticator`, `SCRAM_SHA_1_ServerAuthenticator`, and `SCRAM_SHA_1_PLUS_ServerAuthenticator`. These subclasses extend the `SCRAMClientAuthenticator` and `SCRAMServerAuthenticator` classes, providing implementations specific to the SHA-1 hashing algorithm.

The `SCRAM_SHA_1_ClientAuthenticator` and `SCRAM_SHA_1_PLUS_ClientAuthenticator` classes override the parent class's `__init__` method, specifying the SHA-1 hash function and whether or not channel binding is enabled.

The `SCRAM_SHA_1_ServerAuthenticator` and `SCRAM_SHA_1_PLUS_ServerAuthenticator` classes also override the parent class's `__init__` method, specifying the SHA-1 hash function and whether or not channel binding is enabled. These classes also define a class method `are_properties_sufficient` that checks if the necessary properties, including channel binding, are provided.

These subclasses provide specific implementations for the SCRAM authentication protocol using the SHA-1 hashing algorithm. The `SCRAM_SHA_1_ClientAuthenticator` and `SCRAM_SHA_1_ServerAuthenticator` are the basic implementations, while the `SCRAM_SHA_1_PLUS_ClientAuthenticator` and `SCRAM_SHA_1_PLUS_ServerAuthenticator` subclasses are enhanced versions that support channel binding.
