The code provided defines several functions that can be used to compute and plot various types of exposures in a financial portfolio.

1. `compute_style_factor_exposures`: This function takes in a DataFrame of positions and a risk factor, and computes the style factor exposures for each position. It returns the total style factor exposure.

2. `plot_style_factor_exposures`: This function plots the style factor exposures over time.

3. `compute_sector_exposures`: This function takes in a DataFrame of positions, a DataFrame of sector labels for each position, and a dictionary of sector mappings. It computes the long and short exposures, gross exposures, and net exposures for each sector. It returns these values as lists.

4. `plot_sector_exposures_longshort`: This function plots the long and short exposures to sectors.

5. `plot_sector_exposures_gross`: This function plots the gross exposures to sectors.

6. `plot_sector_exposures_net`: This function plots the net exposures to sectors.

7. `compute_cap_exposures`: This function takes in a DataFrame of positions and a DataFrame of market capitalizations for each position. It computes the long and short exposures, gross exposures, and net exposures for each market cap bucket. It returns these values as lists.

8. `plot_cap_exposures_longshort`: This function plots the long and short exposures to market caps.

9. `plot_cap_exposures_gross`: This function plots the gross exposures to market caps.

10. `plot_cap_exposures_net`: This function plots the net exposures to market caps.

11. `compute_volume_exposures`: This function takes in a DataFrame of shares held, a DataFrame of trading volumes, and a percentile value. It computes the long, short, and gross exposures to illiquidity based on the proportion of trading volume. It returns these values as DataFrames.

12. `plot_volume_exposures_longshort`: This function plots the long and short exposures to illiquidity based on the trading volume.

13. `plot_volume_exposures_gross`: This function plots the gross exposures to illiquidity based on the trading volume.

Overall, these functions provide a set of tools to analyze and visualize various types of exposures in a financial portfolio.
