This code appears to be a part of a larger program that generates web pages for a photo gallery. 

The code defines a class called PageWriter that is responsible for writing individual media pages. The class inherits from the AbstractWriter class.

The write method of PageWriter takes an album object and a media group as input. It constructs a page using a template file "media.html" and the provided album and media information. It also includes some additional information such as the previous and next media in the group, the index title, settings, and a sigal_link. The constructed page is then written to a file with the same name as the media file, but with the ".html" extension.

The generate_media_pages function takes a gallery object as input. It creates an instance of the PageWriter class and sets the index title as the gallery title. It then iterates over the albums in the gallery and for each album, it creates a list of media groups where each group consists of a media image and its previous and next media. It then calls the write method of the PageWriter instance to generate a page for each media group.

Finally, the register function connects the generate_media_pages function to a signal called "gallery_build", suggesting that this function will be called when the gallery is being built or generated.

Overall, this code is responsible for generating individual media pages for a photo gallery based on the provided album and media information.
