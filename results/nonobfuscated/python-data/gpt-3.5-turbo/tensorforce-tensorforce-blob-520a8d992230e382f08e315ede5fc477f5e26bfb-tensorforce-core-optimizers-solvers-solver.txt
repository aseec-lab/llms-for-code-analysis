The given code is a Python class named "Solver" that is a part of a larger codebase utilizing the TensorFlow and TensorForce libraries. Here is a breakdown of what each part of the code does:

1. Imports:
   - "import tensorflow as tf": Imports the TensorFlow library.
   - "from tensorforce import util": Imports the "util" module from the TensorForce library.
   - "import tensorforce.core.optimizers.solvers": Imports the "solvers" module from the "optimizers" module in the "core" module of the TensorForce library.

2. Class definition:
   - "class Solver(object)": Defines a new class named "Solver" that inherits from the "object" class (base class for all classes in Python).

3. Class constructor:
   - "def __init__(self)": Defines the constructor method of the "Solver" class.
   - "self.solve = tf.make_template(name_='solver', func_=self.tf_solve)": Creates a TensorFlow template called "solver" by calling the "make_template()" function from the "tf" module. The template is defined by the "self.tf_solve" method.

4. Method definition:
   - "def tf_solve(self, fn_x, *args)": Defines the "tf_solve" method of the "Solver" class, which takes in a function "fn_x" and variable number of arguments "*args".
   - "raise NotImplementedError": Raises a "NotImplementedError" if this method is not overridden by any subclass.

5. Static method definition:
   - "@staticmethod": Indicates that the following method is a static method (not dependent on the class instance).
   - "def from_config(config, kwargs=None)": Defines the "from_config" method that takes in a "config" object and an optional "kwargs" dictionary as arguments.
   - "return util.get_object(...)": Calls the "get_object()" function from the "util" module, passing the "config", "predefined" (solvers module from the optimizers module in the core module of TensorForce), and "kwargs" as arguments. The purpose of this method is to return an object based on the provided "config" and "kwargs" arguments.

Overall, this code defines a basic structure for a "Solver" class in the context of a larger codebase utilizing TensorFlow and TensorForce libraries. The class has a constructor, a template method, and a static method for object creation. The code would require further implementation of the "tf_solve" method and may require additional methods depending on the specific use case.
