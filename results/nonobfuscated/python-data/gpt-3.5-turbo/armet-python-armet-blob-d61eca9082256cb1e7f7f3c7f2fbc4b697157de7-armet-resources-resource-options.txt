This code defines a class called "ResourceOptions" and several helper functions. The "ResourceOptions" class is used to configure the options for a resource in the Armet framework. 

The code imports several modules and classes from other files, including "utils", "authentication", "authorization", and "connectors". It also imports the "ImproperlyConfigured" exception from the "armet.exceptions" module.

The function "_merge" is a helper function that merges the options from the base classes and the meta options passed to the "ResourceOptions" class. It returns the merged options.

The constructor of the "ResourceOptions" class initializes various attributes based on the meta and data options passed as arguments. The attributes include "debug", "abstract", "name", "asynchronous", "connectors", "options", "patterns", "trailing_slash", "http_allowed_methods", "http_allowed_headers", "http_exposed_headers", "http_allowed_origins", "legacy_redirect", "serializers", "allowed_serializers", "default_serializer", "deserializers", "allowed_deserializers", "authentication", and "authorization". These attributes are used to configure the behavior of a resource in the Armet framework.

Overall, this code defines a class and several helper functions for configuring the options of a resource in the Armet framework.
