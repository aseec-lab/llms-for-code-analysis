This code is written in Python and uses the asyncio library to set up an asynchronous connection and stream frames from a Qualisys Track Manager (QTM) motion capture system.

The main part of the code is the `on_packet` function, which takes a packet object as an argument and prints the frame number and component information of the packet. It then iterates through the 3D markers in the packet and prints each marker.

The `setup` function is defined as an asynchronous function and is marked with the `async` keyword. It first connects to the QTM system at the IP address "127.0.0.1" using the `qtm.connect()` function. If the connection is successful (`connection` is not `None`), it then starts streaming frames with the components set to "3d" and registers the `on_packet` function as the callback to be called when a packet is received.

In the main block, the `setup` function is called as an asynchronous task using `asyncio.ensure_future()`. The `run_forever()` function is then called on the event loop to keep the program running indefinitely.

Overall, this code connects to a QTM system and streams 3D marker data, printing the frame number and marker information for each received packet.
