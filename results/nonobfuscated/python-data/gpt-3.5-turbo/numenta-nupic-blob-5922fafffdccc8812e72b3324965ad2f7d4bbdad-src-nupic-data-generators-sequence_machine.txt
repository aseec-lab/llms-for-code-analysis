This code defines a class called 'SequenceMachine' which is used to generate sequences of patterns. 

The class has several methods:
1. __init__: Initializes the SequenceMachine object with a patternMachine and a seed for generating random numbers.
2. generateFromNumbers: Takes a list of numbers and generates a sequence of patterns using the patternMachine.
3. addSpatialNoise: Takes a sequence of patterns and adds noise to each pattern using the patternMachine.
4. prettyPrintSequence: Takes a sequence of patterns and converts it into a human-readable text representation.
5. generateNumbers: Generates a list of numbers to be used as input for generating sequences, with the option to include a shared range of numbers.

The code also imports the numpy library and the Random class from the nupic.bindings.math module.
