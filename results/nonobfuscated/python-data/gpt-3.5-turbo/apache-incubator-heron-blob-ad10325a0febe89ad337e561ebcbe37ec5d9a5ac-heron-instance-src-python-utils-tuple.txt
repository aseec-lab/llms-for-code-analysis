The code provided defines several helper functions related to working with tuples in a Heron topology. Here is an analysis of each function:

1. `make_tuple(stream, tuple_key, values, roots=None)`
   - This function takes in a stream, a tuple key, a list of values, and an optional `roots` parameter.
   - It retrieves the component name and stream ID from the given stream object.
   - It determines the generator task ID from the `roots` parameter (if provided).
   - It creates a new `HeronTuple` object using the provided values and additional information such as component name, stream ID, generator task ID, creation time, and roots.
   - Finally, it returns the created `HeronTuple` object.

2. `make_tick_tuple()`
   - This function creates a special "tick" tuple that is used internally in the Heron framework for system-level operations.
   - It creates a new `HeronTuple` object with a fixed ID, component name, stream ID, and other attributes.
   - The creation time is set to the current time, and no roots are specified.
   - The created `HeronTuple` object is returned.

3. `make_root_tuple_info(stream_id, tuple_id)`
   - This function takes in a stream ID and a tuple ID.
   - It generates a random key using the `random.getrandbits` function with the maximum number of bits set to `TupleHelper.MAX_SFIXED64_RAND_BITS`.
   - It creates a new `RootTupleInfo` object with the provided stream ID, tuple ID, current insertion time, and the generated key.
   - The created `RootTupleInfo` object is returned.

These functions are part of a larger codebase and are meant to provide convenient ways to create tuples and tuple-related information in a Heron topology. The `HeronTuple` and `RootTupleInfo` namedtuples are used to represent the tuples and tuple information respectively.
