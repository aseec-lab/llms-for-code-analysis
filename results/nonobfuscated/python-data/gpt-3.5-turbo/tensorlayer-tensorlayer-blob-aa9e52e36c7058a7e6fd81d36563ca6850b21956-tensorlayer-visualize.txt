The given code is a collection of utility functions for reading and manipulating images. Here is a breakdown of the functions and their purposes:

1. `read_image(image, path='')`: This function reads an image file from the specified path and returns it as a numpy array.

2. `read_images(img_list, path='', n_threads=10, printable=True)`: This function reads multiple images specified in `img_list` from the specified `path` using multiple threads. It returns a list of numpy arrays representing the images.

3. `save_image(image, image_path='_temp.png')`: This function saves the given image as a file with the specified image path.

4. `save_images(images, size, image_path='_temp.png')`: This function saves a grid of images specified in the `images` parameter. The images should be in the shape (batch_size, height, width, channels). The `size` parameter specifies the number of rows and columns in the grid.

5. `draw_boxes_and_labels_to_image(image, classes, coords, scores, classes_list, is_center=True, is_rescale=True, save_name=None)`: This function draws bounding boxes and labels on an image. It takes the image, class labels, coordinates of the bounding boxes, scores of the predictions, and a list of class names. It returns the image with the bounding boxes and labels drawn on it.

6. `draw_mpii_pose_to_image(image, poses, save_name='image.png')`: This function draws the MPII pose estimation results on the given image. It takes the image and a list of pose dictionaries as input. Each pose dictionary should contain the joint positions and head rectangle coordinates. It returns the image with the pose lines and joint points drawn on it.

7. `draw_mpii_people_to_image(image, poses, save_name='image.png')`: This function is an alias for `draw_mpii_pose_to_image()`.

8. `frame(I=None, second=5, saveable=True, name='frame', cmap=None, fig_idx=12836)`: This function displays an image frame using matplotlib. It takes the image, display duration, saveable flag, title, colormap, and figure index as input. The image can be a grayscale or color image.

9. `CNN2d(CNN=None, second=10, saveable=True, name='cnn', fig_idx=3119362)`: This function displays the output of a 2D CNN layer using matplotlib. It takes the output tensor of the CNN layer, display duration, saveable flag, title, and figure index as input. The output tensor should have the shape (height, width, channels).

10. `images2d(images=None, second=10, saveable=True, name='images', dtype=None, fig_idx=3119362)`: This function displays a grid of images using matplotlib. It takes the grid of images, display duration, saveable flag, title, data type, and figure index as input. The images should be in the shape (batch_size, height, width, channels).

11. `tsne_embedding(embeddings, reverse_dictionary, plot_only=500, second=5, saveable=False, name='tsne', fig_idx=9862)`: This function applies t-SNE dimensionality reduction to the given embeddings and plots the result in 2D space using matplotlib. It takes the embeddings, reverse dictionary mapping, number of points to plot, display duration, saveable flag, title, and figure index as input. The embeddings should be a numpy array with shape (num_embeddings, embedding_dim).The remaining code consists of two functions:

1. `plot_with_labels(low_dim_embs, labels, figsize=(18, 18), second=5, saveable=True, name='tsne', fig_idx=9862)`: This function plots the embeddings in 2D space using matplotlib. It takes the low-dimensional embeddings, labels, figure size, display duration, saveable flag, title, and figure index as input. It iterates over each embedding and its corresponding label, plots the embedding as a scatter point, and annotates the point with the label. If the `saveable` flag is set to True, it saves the plot as a PDF file. Otherwise, it displays the plot and pauses for the specified duration.

2. `draw_weights(W=None, second=10, saveable=True, shape=None, name='mnist', fig_idx=2396512)`: This function visualizes the weights of a neural network layer. It takes the weight matrix, display duration, saveable flag, shape of the weights, title, and figure index as input. It creates a subplot for each unit in the weight matrix, normalizes the weights, and displays them as grayscale images. If the `saveable` flag is set to True, it saves the plot as a PDF file. Otherwise, it displays the plot and pauses for the specified duration.

The last line of the code assigns the `draw_weights` function to the variable `W`.
