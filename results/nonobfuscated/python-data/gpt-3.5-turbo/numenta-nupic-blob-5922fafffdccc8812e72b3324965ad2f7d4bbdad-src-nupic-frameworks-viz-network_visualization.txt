This code defines a class called NetworkVisualizer. The class has a constructor that takes in a network object as a parameter and assigns it to a class variable called "network".

The class has two methods:

1. export(): This method creates a graph object from the network object. It creates a MultiDiGraph object from the networkx library and then iterates over the regions in the network. It adds each region as a node to the graph with the region name as the label. It then iterates over the links in the network and adds each link as an edge to the graph.

2. render(): This method renders the graph using a renderer object. It calls the render() method of the renderer object and passes in the graph object created by the export() method.

The code also imports the networkx library and the DotRenderer class from the nupic.frameworks.viz module with the alias DEFAULT_RENDERER.
