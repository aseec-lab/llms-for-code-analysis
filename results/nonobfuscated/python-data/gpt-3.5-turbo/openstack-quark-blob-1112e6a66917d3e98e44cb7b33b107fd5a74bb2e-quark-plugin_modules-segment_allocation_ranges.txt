This code is a module for managing segment allocation ranges. Segment allocation ranges are used to allocate segments of a specific type and range for use in networking. 

The code provides functions for getting segment allocation ranges, creating new segment allocation ranges, and deleting existing segment allocation ranges. 

Here is a breakdown of each function:

- get_segment_allocation_range: Retrieves a specific segment allocation range by ID. This function requires admin privileges and returns information about the range including its allocations.

- get_segment_allocation_ranges: Retrieves all segment allocation ranges based on optional filtering criteria. This function requires admin privileges and returns a list of dictionaries containing information about each range.

- create_segment_allocation_range: Creates a new segment allocation range. This function requires admin privileges and takes a dictionary containing information about the new range. The function validates the input and uses a strategy from the segment allocations registry to create and populate the range.

- delete_segment_allocation_range: Deletes a specific segment allocation range by ID. This function requires admin privileges and first checks if there are any allocations associated with the range. If there are allocations, it raises an exception. Otherwise, it deletes the range.
