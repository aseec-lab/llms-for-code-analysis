This code implements the ROOM (Relaxation of Objective on Metabolism) method in metabolic modeling. The `room` function is the main function that applies the ROOM method to a metabolic model. It takes in a metabolic model, an optional solution, and other parameters such as whether to use a linear approximation, the delta value, and the epsilon value. 

The `add_room` function is a helper function called within the `room` function. It adds the necessary constraints and variables to the model to apply the ROOM method. It takes similar parameters as the `room` function. 

The main steps of the code are as follows:

1. If the model has already been adjusted for ROOM (indicated by the presence of the 'room_old_objective' variable), an error is raised.
2. If no solution is provided, the pFBA (parsimonious flux balance analysis) method is used to obtain an initial solution.
3. The variables and constraints for the ROOM method are created and added to the model. 
4. The objective function of the model is set to minimize a constant value, effectively removing the original objective.
5. The variables and constraints related to the reactions in the model are created.
6. The variables, constraints, and objective coefficients are added to the model.
7. The new objective coefficients for the ROOM variables are set to 1. 

Overall, this code modifies a metabolic model to implement the ROOM method, which adjusts the objective function to relax constraints and allow for alternative optimal solutions.
