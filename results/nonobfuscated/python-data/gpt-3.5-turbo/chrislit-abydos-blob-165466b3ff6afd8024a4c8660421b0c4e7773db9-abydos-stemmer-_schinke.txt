The code is implementing the Schinke stemmer algorithm for stemming words in the English language. Stemming is the process of reducing a word to its base or root form.

The main class in the code is `Schinke`, which is a subclass of `_Stemmer`. It defines various sets and dictionaries of endings to be stripped or altered in order to stem words. The `stem` method in the `Schinke` class takes a word as input and applies the stemming algorithm to return a dictionary with both the noun and verb stems of the word.

The `schinke` function is a convenience wrapper around the `Schinke` class, which creates an instance of `Schinke` and calls its `stem` method. This function can be used to stem a word without directly instantiating the `Schinke` class.

The code includes an `if __name__ == '__main__'` block that allows for running `doctest` to test the code.
