This code defines a class `TensorFlowModel` which is a subclass of `DifferentiableModel`. 

The `TensorFlowModel` class is used for creating and manipulating TensorFlow models. It takes in images, logits, bounds, channel axis, and preprocessing parameters as arguments. The class has various methods such as `num_classes`, `batch_predictions`, `predictions_and_gradient`, `gradient`, etc. that perform operations on the model. 

The `from_keras` class method is used to create a `TensorFlowModel` instance from a Keras model. It takes in a Keras model, bounds, input shape, channel axis, and preprocessing parameters as arguments.

The code also includes import statements for various libraries such as `numpy`, `tensorflow`, and `logging`.
