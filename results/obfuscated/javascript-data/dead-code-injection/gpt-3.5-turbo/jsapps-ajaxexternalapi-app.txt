The code is written in JavaScript and appears to be a web scraping script. 

First, there is a declaration of a constant variable `a0_0x5ac3c6` which is assigned a value `a0_0x26ef`. 

Then, there is a self-invoking function that takes two parameters `_0x264830` and `_0x58a237`. Inside this function, there is a while loop that runs indefinitely (`while(!![]){}`). The loop contains a try-catch block.

Inside the try block, there is a mathematical operation assigned to the variable `_0x70d6df` which involves several `parseInt` operations on substrings of the constant `_0x19cd7e`. This variable is then compared to `_0x58a237`. If they are equal, the loop breaks, otherwise, an element is pushed to the end of an array (`_0x48f36f`) and then shifted from the beginning of the array.

If an exception is thrown in the try block, the same push and shift operations are performed on the array.

After the self-invoking function, there is a console statement that logs `':D'`.

Then, there is a declaration of two variables `botonDolar` and `botonBitcoin` using the `document.querySelector` method to select elements with IDs `'dolar'` and `'bitcoin'` respectively.

After that, there are event listener assignments to the `click` event for `botonDolar` and `botonBitcoin`, both triggering the `obtenerDatos` function with different arguments.

The `obtenerDatos` function takes a parameter `_0x15898c` and creates a new `XMLHttpRequest` object `_0x5b3720`. It then sets up the request using the `open` method with a `'GET'` method, a URL generated using the `_0x15898c` parameter, and `true` for asynchronous. After that, it calls the `send` method and sets the `onreadystatechange` event handler to the `respuesta` function.

The `respuesta` function checks if the `readyState` of the XMLHttpRequest object is `4` (indicating the request has been completed) and the `status` is `200` (indicating a successful response). It then parses the `responseText` as JSON and logs the parsed result to the console.

Finally, it selects an element with the ID `'resultado'`, clears its innerHTML, and iterates over the elements in the `'serie'` property of the parsed JSON object. It builds HTML list items with the date and value of each element and appends them to the selected element. If the loop iterates more than 15 times, it breaks. 

The two functions `a0_0x26ef` and `a0_0x1105` are used as obfuscation techniques to hide the actual values and names of variables and functions. They are used for string manipulation and generation of substrings.
