This code defines a class called `ToDoList`. The class has a constructor that initializes an empty array called `_list`. 

The class has three methods:
1. `getList()` returns the `_list` array.
2. `clearList()` sets the `_list` array to an empty array.
3. `addItemList()` takes an input `_0x21f2c2` and adds it to the `_list` array.
4. `removeItemFromList()` takes an input `_0x2a4262` and removes the item with matching `_id` from the `_list` array.

The code also includes some obfuscated code, but it seems to be related to generating an array of obfuscated strings and performing some operations on them.
