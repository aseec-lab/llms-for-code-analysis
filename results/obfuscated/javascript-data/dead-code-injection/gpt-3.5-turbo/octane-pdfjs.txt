The code appears to be using obfuscation techniques. It defines several functions named with random characters, assigns variables with obfuscated names, and uses code that is difficult to understand.

Based on the available code chunks, it seems that the code is setting up a PDF viewer using PdfJS library. It defines a function called `runPdfJS` that calls `PDFJS.getDocument()` to load a PDF file and render it onto a canvas element. The rendered canvas contexts are stored in the `canvas_logs` array.

The `setupPdfJS` function sets up the PdfJS library by checking if the required browser features are available, and if so, it sets the `pdf_file` variable and registers the PDF file with the PdfJS window object.

The `tearDownPdfJS` function iterates over the `canvas_logs` array and performs some checks on the rendered canvas contexts.

Other helper functions like `buffer` and `hash` are used to handle data manipulation.

Overall, the code sets up a PDF viewer using PdfJS library and manages some related tasks such as setup and teardown. However, the exact details and purposes of the code may not be easily understandable due to the obfuscation.##########
