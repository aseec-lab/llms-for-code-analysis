The code defines a function called `a0_0x1771` and assigns it to a constant variable `a0_0xa5295d`. The function takes two parameters `_0x47e945` and `_0x339508`. 

Inside the function, there is a variable `_0x3e373a` that is assigned the result of calling another function `a0_0x3e37()`. Then, the function reassigns itself with modified parameter names. 

After that, there is a self-invoking function which takes two parameters `_0x5bf67e` and `_0x364d60`. Inside the self-invoking function, there is a while loop that continuously executes. 

Inside the while loop, there is a try-catch block where it attempts to calculate the value of `_0x4742b2` based on some calculations involving parsing integers. If the calculated value is equal to the value of `_0x364d60`, the loop breaks. Otherwise, it pushes the first element of the `_0x20770f` array to the end of the array.

Outside the self-invoking function, there is a statement that assigns the value of `a0_0xa5295d(0x114)` to a constant variable `nombre`. It then uses `localStorage` to store the value of `nombre` with the key `'nombreUsuario'`.

The code then retrieves the value of `'nombreUsuario'` from `localStorage` and assigns it to a variable `nombreLocalStorage`. 

The code logs the value of `nombreLocalStorage` to the console.

Next, it selects HTML elements using `document.querySelector()` and assigns them to variables `btnBotones`, `botones`, and `fondo`.

Later, there are two immediately-invoked arrow functions. The first one checks the value of `localStorage` with key `'_0x404700(0x102)'` and sets the `class` name of `fondo` element based on the condition. The second arrow function adds event listeners to `btnBotones` and `botones` elements.

After that, there are two regular functions defined: `agregarBotones()` and `delegacion()`. The `agregarBotones()` function prevents the default behavior of an event and sets the `innerHTML` of `botones` to the string `'primary'`.

The `delegacion()` function also prevents the default behavior of an event and logs the classList of the event target to the console. Then, it checks the value of the second element in the classList and sets the `class` name of `fondo` element and stores the value in `localStorage` based on the condition.

Finally, there is a function `a0_0x3e37()` that returns an array of strings containing various class names and other values.
