The code defines several functions and variables related to drawing on a canvas using the HTML5 canvas API. 

The main function of the code is to draw different weather icons on a canvas. Each weather icon is represented by a series of shapes and lines drawn on the canvas.

The code first defines a function "a0_0x3d9e()" that returns an array of strings. This function is used to obfuscate the strings used in the code.

Next, the code defines a function "a0_0x135b()" that takes two parameters and returns a value from the array returned by the "a0_0x3d9e()" function. This function is used to retrieve the obfuscated strings.

The code then defines an immediately invoked function expression (IIFE) that takes a function as a parameter. Inside the IIFE, several variables and functions are defined. 

The IIFE checks if the browser supports the "requestAnimationFrame" and "cancelAnimationFrame" functions, and if not, falls back to using "setTimeout" and "clearTimeout". This is used to create a continuous animation loop.

Next, the code defines several helper functions for drawing shapes, lines, and arcs on the canvas.

After that, the code defines a function "_0x46d8fa()" that takes four parameters and uses the helper functions to draw a line on the canvas.

The code also defines a function "_0x27429f()" that takes six parameters and uses the helper functions to draw an arc on the canvas.

There are also functions "_0x5bff42()", "_0xbcf51()", "_0x1de737()", and "_0x4b23ed()" that are responsible for drawing more complex shapes on the canvas.

Overall, the code is used to draw different weather icons on a canvas using the HTML5 canvas API.##########
