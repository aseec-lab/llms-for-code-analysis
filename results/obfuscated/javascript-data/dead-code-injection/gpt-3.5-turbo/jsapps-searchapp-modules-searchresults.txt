The code appears to be a JavaScript module that exports several functions related to manipulating and displaying search results.

The first chunk of code defines a function `a0_0x180c` that takes two parameters `_0x1fba04` and `_0x2bd64d`. This function is used as a helper function in the code and is repeatedly called with different arguments.

The second chunk of code exports a function `deleteSearchResults()`. This function finds an element with the id "search-results" and removes all of its child elements one by one until there are no more child elements left.

The third chunk of code exports a function `buildSearchResults(_0x577f47)`. This function takes an array of search results as a parameter. It iterates over the array and creates HTML elements to display each search result. The HTML elements are then appended to an element with the id "search-results".

The fourth chunk of code exports two functions `clearStatsLine()` and `setStatsLine(_0x5aec67)`. These functions manipulate the text content of an element with the id "stats". The `clearStatsLine()` function sets the text content to an empty string, while the `setStatsLine(_0x5aec67)` function sets the text content to a string that includes the value of the `_0x5aec67` parameter.

The last chunk of code defines three helper functions `createResultItem(_0x1121dd)`, `createResultImage(_0x1935ae)`, and `createResultText(_0x5c47f4)`. These functions create HTML elements for displaying a single search result item.
