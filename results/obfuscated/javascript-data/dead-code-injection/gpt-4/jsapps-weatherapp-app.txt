The given code is JavaScript code in heavily obfuscated manner. It uses a mix of what seem hexadecimal values and random string identifiers to make the code less-readable. The identifiers are, however, consistent throughout, which suggests they may be replacing consistent function calls or variable names.

In general terms, this code appears to complete the following:

1. Retrieves the user's current geographic position (latitude & longitude) assuming the user provides browser permission to do so.

2. Makes a request to the DarkSky weather API with these geographic coordinates to get the current weather data for the user's location.

3. Displays data such as the timezone, current temperature, and a description of the weather on the page, and also displays an icon representing the current weather conditions using skycons.

4. It also provides a feature to switch the temperature between Fahrenheit and Celsius when an element is clicked on.

Overall, it looks like the purpose of the code is to show current weather conditions for a user's specific location.
