This code primarily handles some functionalities of a webpage like button behavior and local storage of data. However, variable and function names are obscured, making it cluttered and hard to understand.

Here's the functionality of a few specific sections:

1. `a0_0x1771(_0x47e945,_0x339508)` : This function likely fetches an array of strings from the function `a0_0x3e37()`. 

2. The large anonymous function `(a0_0x3e37,0x952f9)`: This is involved in an obfuscation technique, which seems to rearrange elements within the array fetched from `a0_0x3e37()`.

3. `localStorage[a0_0xa5295d(0x101)](a0_0xa5295d(0x104),nombre)`: This bit of code is probably meant to store a value associated with the key `nombre` in the webpage's local storage.

4. `const btnBotones=document[a0_0xa5295d(0x11a)](a0_0xa5295d(0x10c))`: Retrieves a specific HTML element using a selector which is fetched from the function `a0_0x3e37()`.

5. `btnBotones[_0x702c7b(0x10b)](_0x702c7b(0x10f),agregarBotones)`: Attaches an event listener to the button. When the button is clicked, it runs the function `agregarBotones`.

6. The function `agregarBotones()` is used for handling the 'click' event on some buttons and likely adds more buttons to the webpage.

7. The function `delegacion()` seems to change the background color of an element according to a button click, and stores this color in local storage.

Keep in mind that this interpretation might not be 100% accurate due to the obfuscated nature of the provided code.
