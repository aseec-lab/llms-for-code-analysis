This JavaScript code appears to be using a Wikipedia API to get search results for user input. Here's a detailed breakdown of what it does:

1. The code uses a combination of hexadecimal (0x notation) values and strings to create arrays and functions.

2. The `getSearchTerm` function retrieves the search term entered by the user in an HTML element called 'search'. It also removes any excessive spaces from the search term.

3. The `retrieveSearchResults` function passes the search term to the `getwikiSearchString` function. This function constructs the Wikipedia API URL with the search term. 

4. The `getMaxChars` function determines the number of characters to extract from each extracted page from Wikipedia API, based on the width of the window size.

5. The `requestData` function takes the Wikipedia API URL for a search, fetched the result of the request, and returns the data as JSON.

6. The `processWikiResults` function processes the JSON data received from Wikipedia API and creates an array of objects, each object having an 'id', 'title', 'img' and 'text'.

These are the exported functions:
- `getSearchTerm`: This function retrieves the search term from an input field.
- `retrieveSearchResults`: This function passes the search term to the `getwikiSearchString` function and fetches the data from Wikipedia. Once it has finished fetching data, it calls `processWikiResults` to process the JSON data received and returns the processed data.

In the first chunk of code, it runs a function which performs some operations with hexadecimal values, and the result is compared with a given hexadecimal number. If the comparison fails, it rearranges the elements in the array returned by `a0_0x13a1` function. It continues until the comparison succeeds. 

It is important to note that without more context (such as HTML code or other related code) the full functionality of the code may not be understood completely. 

The code is somewhat obfuscated, perhaps for security reasons. Also, it doesn't contain any malicious properties, but proper testing is always recommended before use.
