The code is implementing a custom audio and video player that has a "play", "pause" and "replay" functionality. The control buttons appear to change their icon based on the state of the media being played (playing, paused). 

The player is capable of handling multiple sounds and videos. It executes specific behavior based on events like clicking on the control buttons, or selecting a sound or video. Each sound and video appears to be associated with certain data attributes that are used to retrieve its source URL. 

The `checkPlaying` function is checking if the sound or video is already playing, and if so, it pauses it and changes the icon to represent the 'pause' state. If it's not playing, it plays the sound or video and changes the icon to the 'play' state. 

The `ontimeupdate` event is used to update the current time of the media being played on the display, and also to animate a moving outline according to the progress of the played media. When the media playback reaches its end, it is paused and rewound to the beginning, and the play button icon is set back to its initial state.

The sounds and timeSelect arrays appear to hold elements that each corresponds to a different sound or a different playback duration, respectively. When an element from these arrays is clicked, the source of the media and the duration of the playback is set or updated to match the data attributes of the clicked element. 

Additionally, the code uses a mechanism for obfuscating the actual function and variable names in order to protect the intellectual property within the code or to deter unauthorized access or use.
