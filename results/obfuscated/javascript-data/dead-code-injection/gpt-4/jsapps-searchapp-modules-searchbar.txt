This is a Javascript program that provides several functions to interact with a webpage. Due to the usage of hexadecimal character codes and obfuscation techniques used, it is quite a bit tricky to read, but the core functions performed by the code are as follows:

1. `setSearchFocus()` - This function is exported and when invoked it seems to be looking for a DOM element (likely an input field due to the focus function) and setting focus to that element.

2. `showClearTextButton()` - This function is also exported and it gets two DOM elements using their IDs. It checks if the "value" of the first element is greater than zero and based on that it toggles between two classes for the second DOM element.

3. `clearSearchText(_0x1cca58)` - Another exported function, which seems to be clearing the search text (hence setting the 'value' of a DOM element, likely an input field, to '') and toggling the classes of another element. It takes an argument of `event` type and calls preventDefault() on it.

4. `clearPushListener(_0x3f613d)` - Given the code, it seems that when Enter or Space is pressed down (it's checking for 'Enter' or 'Space' in `_0x3f613d['key']`), the default action is prevented and then it's triggering a "click" event.

The first block of code performs some calculation using hexadecimal values, which seems to have evading purpose to make it difficult to analyze.

The functions `a0_0x309a()` and `a0_0x4d18()` look like they are intended to obfuscate the code, but in actual they are returning hexadecimal values, which are likely used to represent common JavaScript keywords or DOM attributes/methods. 

Note: The specific tasks that the code is performing would depend on the structure of the HTML the script is interacting with.
