This code defines and exports a class named `ToDoList`. The class is designed to handle a list of items for a to-do list. The code is written in JavaScript utilizing some obfuscated sections for reasons such as security and/or ensuring some part of the code functionality isn't easily modified.

Here's how it works:

- `constructor()`: A constructor function which initialises an array `_list`. This empty array underscore list is essentially the to-do list.

- `getList()`: This function returns the current state of the to-do list (`_list`). 

- `clearList()`: This function clears the to-do list (`_list`) by assigning it an empty array.

- `addItemList(_item)`: This function adds a new item (`_item`) to the `_list`. Here, `_item` is the parameter to be added.

- `removeItemFromList(_id)`: This function removes an item from `_list`. It takes an `_id` as a parameter, used to find and remove the item. It loops over `_list` and when it finds the `_id` within list, it removes the item and breaks out of the loop.

The code also includes sizable chunks of obfuscation and hexadecimal character manipulation, apparently used to disguise or protect some part of the code functionality.
