This is JavaScript code with obfuscated variable and function names. Here's the general functioning of the code:

1. Sets `a0_0x5ac3c6` equal to `a0_0x26ef`, a function defined later that seems to map a number to a different value using `_0x11058e`.

2. An Immediately Invoked Function Expression (IIFE) is run. This is a complex part of the code with a while loop, and seems to adjust the array constructed by `_0x264830()` based on some calculation over multiple parsed integers.

3. Two elements are fetched from the document, presumably buttons with ids `#dolar` and `#bitcoin`.

4. `click` event listeners are added to both buttons. When either button is clicked `obtenerDatos` function is called with either `dolar` or `bitcoin` as function argument.

5. `obtenerDatos(_0x15898c)`: This function uses XMLHttpRequest to fetch data from a URL constructed with "https://mindicador.cl/api/" and the input parameter, that can be either `dolar` or `bitcoin`, which presumably are data points the function is trying to fetch.

6. `respuesta`: This function appears to be a callback function for handling the response from the `XMLHttpRequest`. It parses the received JSON and logs it to the console. Then it finds an element with the id `#resultado` and populates it with items from the parsed JSON.

So overall, it assigns event listeners to two buttons, which fetches data for either dollar or bitcoin when clicked, and then populates an html element with this data.
