This JavaScript code is a bit obfuscated and mostly does the trick with HTML elements and event handlers. 

This program seems to create a set of buttons and assign them appropriate classes and corresponding text values (primary, secondary, danger, success, warning). It is assigning click event listeners to the buttons. 

The function agregarBotones essentially prevents the page from reloading when the button is clicked while the function delegacion captures the classname of the button that was clicked and changes the background colour of a certain part of the page (referenced by the 'fondo' variable) according to which button was clicked.

Here's a breakdown:

Firstly, the several use of hexadecimal values (0x13e, 0x146, etc.) are part of an obfuscation technique. It's trying to make the code harder to understand by using hexadecimal values instead of normal numbers.

Then, several variables are declared those seem like hexed-hashed strings which are random and won't make any sense, The use of a hexadecimal way of labeling an array with a function is another method for obfuscation. These confused variable names and functions (with hexadecimal indexes) are likely meant to make the code hard to read for humans.

The part `(function(_0x2ecfe7,_0x4470d5){...}(a0_0x189a,0x3b728))` seems like an obfuscation technique. It's defining an anonymous function that does some operations (including push and shift operation on an array) and immediately invoking it with 'a0_0x189a' and '0x3b728' as arguments.

The lines `btnBotones[_0x3c43b7(0x133)](_0x3c43b7(0x141),agregarBotones)` and `botones[_0x3c43b7(0x133)](_0x3c43b7(0x141),delegacion)` are adding click event listeners to some HTML elements.

The function `agregarBotones` is setting the innerHTML of 'botones' to a string that represents several button elements. Here 'preventDefault' is used to prevent the default form submission event when the button is clicked.

Function `delegacion` gets the name of the clicked button and applies a specific "bg-*" class based on which button is clicked. The switch statement in this function is used to set different background colors for different buttons.

Please note these variables 'btnBotones', 'botones', and 'fondo' are actually HTML elements and can be anything which makes the code overall unanalyzeable without the full context. 

Lastly, without the context (e.g., the associated HTML, the rest of the script), it is a bit difficult to tell exactly what the practical applications of this script are. But it is likely used in a website that has interactivity and UI manipulation involved.
