This JavaScript code is a simple to-do list application. It is designed to add, display, and delete tasks. Each task contains a title and a description. This code utilizes local storage to store the tasks.

Here is an explanation of the code:

1. It creates a function `a0_0x5742(_0x416a23,_0x5c78be)` to compute a value based on its own array `_0x36eca0`. However, the true purpose of this function is obfuscated.

2. It creates `formTask` variable that selects an element in the HTML document with the help of `document[a0_0x1964fa(0x165)]` method. 

3. It adds an event listener to `formTask` on the 'submit' event. When the form is submitted, it executes the `saveTask` function.

4. The `saveTask` function prevents the default form submission. It collects the task title and description and verifies whether they are not empty. If they are, it invokes `inputEmpty` function which logs 'empty' to the console. If they aren't, the function creates a task object and adds it to the tasks in the local storage.

5. It includes a `getTask` function that gets the tasks from the local storage, converts them from JSON format and appends them into the HTML document as an unordered list.

6. The `deleteTask(_0xee4ce3)` function deletes a task by the given title `_0xee4ce3`. It checks each task's title in the local storage. If a task with the given title is found, it is removed from the storage.

7. At the end of the script, it calls the getTask() function to display all existing tasks as it starts to run.
