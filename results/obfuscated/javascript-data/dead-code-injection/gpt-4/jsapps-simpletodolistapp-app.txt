The code implements a very simple "todo" application in Javascript with functionality to add and remove tasks.

Here's a detailed look at what it does:

1. The code begins by defining a number of obfuscated functions and variables, likely as a method of minification to reduce the size of the script. These would normally be more clearly named for readability.

2. Then, it gets the `todoForm`, `todoInput`, and `itemList` from the document. The `todoForm` is the form where users can input their tasks, the `todoInput` is the input box within the form where users type their tasks in, and the `itemList` is the list where added tasks appear.

3. The script attaches an event listener to `todoForm` that listens for the 'submit' event. When the form is submitted, it prevents the form's default submission behavior, checks if the input field is empty, and if so, calls `inputoEmpty()` to log a message to the console. If the input field is not empty, it calls `addItem()` with the value of `todoInput` to add a new task.

4. `a0_0x163e()` returns an array of hex strings which seem to have been used in character encoding.

5. `inputoEmpty()` logs a message to the console when the input field is empty.

6. `addItem(_0x87b088)` adds a new 'todo' item to the list. It creates a new `<li>` element with the value entered by the user along with a 'x' button to remove the 'todo' item, clears the input field, and sets the focus back to the input field for a new entry.

7. `removeItem(_0x573e85)` removes a 'todo' item when the 'x' button is clicked. It gets the parent element of the clicked 'x' button and removes it from the document.
