This JavaScript code appears to be part of a larger context where it uses Wikipedia's API to search for, retrieve, and process information. Please see the specific functionalities of the different portions of the code below:

1. **Exported Function getSearchTerm:** This function gets and returns the string value from an HTML element whose ID is being returned by `a0_0x2479(0xb9)` and trims the spaces and replaces any two adjacent spaces with a single space.

2. **Exported Function retrieveSearchResults:** This async function retrieves search results for the passed search term, `_0x39e776`. It creates a search URL, sends an asynchronous request to Wikipedia's API via the fetched URL, processes these results, and then returns the processed results.

3. **Nested Function getwikiSearchString:** It returns an encoded Wikipedia search URL string. The number of characters to extract is determined by `getMaxChars` function.

4. **Nested Function getMaxChars:** It returns a number (0x41, 0x5a, or 0x78) based on the client's window width. These hex values convert to decimal as 65, 90, or 120, respectively.

5. **Nested Function requestData:** Makes an HTTP GET request to the provided URL (`_0x58a279`) using the Fetch API. If the fetch is successful, it converts the returned response into JSON format and returns it. In case of an error, it will log the error to the console.

6. **Nested Function processWikiResults:** Processes the received search results from the Wikipedia API, modifies the results into a new format including the id, title, image, and text, then pushes each result into an array and finally returns this array.

7. **Function `a0_0x2479` and `a0_0x442b`:** These look like helper functions to obfuscate certain parts of the code. They map given input values to a set of pre-defined output values.
   
Last but not the least, there's an initial chunk of difficult-to-read and obfuscated code which seems to be encoding static values and mapping them in some way. This might be a part of a mechanism to protect certain parts of the code or generate some static content based on specific input. Unfortunately, there's not enough clear context or information available to further describe the first block of obfuscated code.
