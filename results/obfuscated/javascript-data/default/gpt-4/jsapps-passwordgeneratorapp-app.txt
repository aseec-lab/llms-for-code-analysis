This Javascript code implements a password generator. It allows the user to customize the password length and include numbers, symbols, uppercase letters, and lowercase letters. 

Here are some key points:
- The form with id 'app' is retrieved, and the number of characters for the password is set.
- Various character sets are defined for numbers, symbols, and uppercase and lowercase alphabets.
- Event listeners are added for buttons to increment or decrement the password length, include/exclude symbols, numbers, and upper case letters.
- There is a button that triggers the password generation. It creates the password based on user preferences, randomly selecting from the appropriate character sets.
- There's also a copy button that copies the generated password to the clipboard. After copying, it displays a temporary message to the user indicating that the password has been copied.

This code contains extensive use of hexadecimal numbers and looks obfuscated, which might be done for security or compactness reasons.
One key to decode is to understand the functions `a0_0x2866()` and `a0_0xb0fc()`. These two functions are used together to decode specific array strings based on hexadecimal indices. The indices are further calculated using some arithmetic operations inside the `a0_0xb0fc()` function.
The strings include HTML tags, CSS classes, phrases, alert messages and set of letters, digits, and symbols likely to be used while generating the password. Overall, the script is concerned with managing the options around password generation based on users input and displaying the feedback to the user.
