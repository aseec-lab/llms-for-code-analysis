This JavaScript code exports several methods dealing with search results. Here is a detailed breakdown of the code:

1. a0_0x5b45():
   This function returns an array of constant strings that might be identifiers or descriptors used elsewhere in the code.

2. a0_0x6105(_0xe94284,_0x3f0efe):
   This function seems to perform a mapping or translation task using the a0_0x5b45() function. This function appears to be auto-generated, possibly used in dealing with obfuscation or code protection.

3. deleteSearchResults():
   This exported method selects an element with id 'search-results' from the document (presumably a HTML document) and removes all child elements of that element. This effectively deletes all search results from the display.

4. buildSearchResults(_0x1c201c):
   This exported method accepts an array _0x1c201c and iterates over each element, constructing a new result item in the document for each one. It constructs the result item by calling helper methods: createResultItem, createResultImage, createResultText. The results are logged in the console and displayed in the 'search-results' section of the document.

5. createResultItem, createResultImage, createResultText:
   These are helper methods involved in creating the HTML structure for each result item.

6. clearStatsLine():
   This exported method clears the text of the element with ID 'stats'. This might be used to clear any previously displayed search statistics.

7. setStatsLine(_0x4e03ef):
   This exported method sets the text of the element with id 'stats'. If _0x4e03ef is provided, it sets the text to "Displaying " plus the number of results. If _0x4e03ef is not provided, it sets the text to "No results".
