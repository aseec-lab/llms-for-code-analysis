This code appears to be employing the usage of obfuscated JavaScript and hexadecimal values, which deconstructs the string and restructures it. It likely employs the use of a function that achieves something similar to an array index lookup from a string array - making it harder to read and understand what the code is doing.

Here is an interpretation of the operations of the code:

1) `a0_0x145f0b` seems to be an alias for `a0_0x23dd`.

2) `a0_0x23dd` is a function that takes in two arguments. It calls `a0_0x40e7()` and assigns its return value to `_0x40e709`, then modifies itself to become a function that fetches items from the `_0x40e709` "array" (using a modified version of the first input) before calling itself one time with the inputs it got. This function could be a form of deobfuscation code.

3) `a0_0x40e7` returns an array which contains string values like 'createElement', 
'transition', 'TransitionEnd', 'style', 'jQuery' and others. It also contains some mix of random-generated string and integer values. This function is used to initialize this array one time, and reuse it on next calls.

4) The function that accepts `_0x2c42e2` and `_0x2d07fc` continuously rearranges the elements of the array returned by `_0x2c42e2()`, based on a complex calculation involving `parseInt()` calls and mathematical operations until a certain condition is met.

5) A function that accepts `_0x10c017` (which is actually `jQuery` object) is declared and invoked immediately. This function extends jQuery's support object for CSS transitions by checking the availability of various browser-specific transition events and ultimately reflects the correct one.

To summarize, the code appears to be a puzzle-like restructuring of array values from hexadecimal to restructure what could potentially be another block of code or data to be processed further. This could be a measure to avoid detection by security systems or to simply obfuscate functionality. An important part of the code is to extend jQuery's capability to support CSS transitions and detect browser-specific events.
