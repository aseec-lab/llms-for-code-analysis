This code creates a fluid simulation. 

The code defines and initiates a set of functions for a fluid simulation. The first chunk of code is a self-invoking function that serves as a wrapper for a while loop. The while loop performs complex mathematical operations on given variables until the condition is met (_0x179e96 === _0x323f11). 

The "NavierStokes" is a benchmark suite, which is usually used for measuring the performance of specific functionalities to evaluate and verify different aspect of software performance.

The `runNavierStokes` function runs the fluid simulation, incrementing the `nsFrameCounter` after each execution. The `checkResult` function checks the sum math calculation of the results and throws an error if it doesn't equal to 0x4d. The `setupNavierStokes` function sets up the FluidField for the simulation. The `tearDownNavierStokes` function resets the solver to null

"addPoints" and "prepareFrame" functions seems to be preparing data which might be used for visualizing the fluid simulation.

The last part of the code creates a function "FluidField" with several nested functions which seems to perform numerical computations required for the fluid simulation.

Please note, this is a kind of obsfucated code used in javaScript for security reason. The variable names are generated in hex representation which makes it hard to understand.The remaining part of the code continues to define various functions for the fluid simulation program that manipulate and calculate different properties of the fluid, such as its density and velocity.

Furthermore, a `FluidField` constructor is created in which the visualization of certain fluid properties are prepared such as adding methods to set and get the density, x-velocity, y-velocity, etc.

Set/update and get/display methods are also provided for further control over the parameters of the fluid field simulation. For example, the number of iterations for a simulation can be set, as it determines the accuracy and computing time of the simulation. Or, the setup for fluid properties arrays can be reset with `reset()`. 

Finally, the `setSize` function checks if the new input size values for width and height are feasible (values should not be negative and should be less than 1,000,000) for resizing the simulation display. Default size is set to 64 by 64.
