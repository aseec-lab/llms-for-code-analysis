The provided code chunk is written in JavaScript (ES6) and involves several exported functions. Each of these functions tackle a certain functionality:

1) setSearchFocus: This funciton sets the focus on the HTML element with the id 'search'.

2) showClearTextButton: This function targets two elements in the DOM with the ids 'search' and 'clear'. If the 'search' element has any content, it manipulates the CSS properties of the 'clear' button to set it's display property to 'flex' (thus making it appear) else, it sets the 'clear' button's display property to 'none' (thus making it disappear).

3) clearSearchText: This function prevents the default behavior of an event (passed as the argument _0x42f5ad), clears the 'search' input text field and displays the 'clear' button.

4) clearPushListener: This function checks the key property on an event object. If the key pressed is 'enter' or 'space', the function triggers a click event on the document element with id 'clear'.

Please note, the functions a0_0x4da9() and a0_0x3c0f(_0x49c048,_0x1e2ef1) seem to be handling obfuscated constants/numbers. This is perhaps part of some cryptography or a way to 'hide' what these values mean. 

The first chunk of code is a somewhat obfuscated, likely part of a minified or compiled code. It's difficult to determine its exact behavior without more context. It seems to be using an IIFE (Immediately Invoked Function Expression) involving obscure hexadecimal numbers and bitwise operations. This pattern is often used in JavaScript obfuscation to make the code harder to understand and reverse-engineer.
