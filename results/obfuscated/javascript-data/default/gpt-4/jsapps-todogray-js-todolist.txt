The provided code defines a JavaScript "ToDoList" class, which is intended for managing a basic to-do list.

According to the structure, each item in the to-do list would be an object with an "_id" property.

This class has five methods:
- The "constructor" method initializes an empty array that serves as the to-do list. Each element in the array represents an item in the to-do list. 

- The "getList" method returns all items in the to-do list. 

- The "clearList" method empties the to-do list.

- The "addItemList" method adds a new item to the to-do list.

- And the "removeItemFromList" method finds and removes an item from the to-do list based on the provided "_id". If the item isn't found, it does nothing.

There are also some "obfuscation" techniques and code in this script â€” a series of encoded strings and encryption functions. This is typically seen when trying to hide the specifics of code execution, either for security or intellectual property reasons. It doesn't significantly affect the overall function and structure of the "ToDoList" class, which manages basic to-do lists as described.
