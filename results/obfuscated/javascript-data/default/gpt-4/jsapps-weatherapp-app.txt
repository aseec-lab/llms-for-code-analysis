The provided JavaScript code appears to be involved in a weather application. It has several components, but here is a high-level overview:

1. The function `a0_0x36bc()` appears to be obfuscated, as does `a0_0x4245()`, but `a0_0x4245()` appears to return an array of strings.

2. It creates variables for different elements of the document, such as temperature location, temperature value, and temperature description. These elements are likely specific elements on the webpage where information will be displayed.

3. It uses the Geolocation API's `getCurrentPosition()` method to get the user's current latitude and longitude.

4. It constructs a URL by concatenating the latitude and longitude with the web address of the Dark Sky API, an internet-based service that provides weather information.

5. It uses the `fetch()` function to send a request to the Dark Sky API to get the weather information for the current location (identified by the latitude and longitude).

6. When the response comes back from the Dark Sky API, it parses the JSON response and extracts relevant weather information. This information includes temperature, summary, and icon of current weather conditions.

7. It uses Skycons, which is a set of weather icons designed for use with the Sky API.

8. Based on the received data, the code then updates the text content of various elements of the webpage (presumably the ones created earlier), displaying the weather information to the user.

9. Additionally, it has an event listener to convert the temperature between Fahrenheit and Celsius when clicked on. 

Please note, the variable names and function names appear to be obfuscated and not descriptive enough to understand what they do without analyzing them deeper and running the code.
