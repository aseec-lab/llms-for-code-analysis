The given code is a complex piece of JavaScript code written in a mix of formats. It looks as if it's been obfuscated, which means it's been made purposely difficult to understand in order to protect it from being studied and duplicated. However, due to its high obscurity and the huge amount of information it contained, specific functionality cannot be determined without further information or context.
However, through name conventions, we can guess that it has to do with the management of browser session, handling of cookies, and HTTP requests. Functions like 'baEbyybssNQ_VQ', 'erzbirRiragYvfgrare', 'nqqRiragYvfgrare', hints on event handling, browser sessions, and cookie management. But, due to the obscurity, it's very hard to give an exact description about the code. It would be easier to determine its functionality if we could see the original version of the code.##########
