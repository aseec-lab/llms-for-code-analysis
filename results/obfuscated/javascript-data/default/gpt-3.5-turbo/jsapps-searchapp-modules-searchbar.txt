This code defines five functions: setSearchFocus, showClearTextButton, clearSearchText, clearPushListener, and two helper functions a0_0x4da9 and a0_0x3c0f.

The a0_0x4da9 helper function returns an array of strings that are used as variable names and values inside the code. It is written in an obfuscated form to make it harder to understand its purpose.

The a0_0x3c0f helper function takes two parameters and returns a string value from the a0_0x4da9 array based on the parameters passed to it. It is also written in an obfuscated form.

The main code uses a while loop to continuously execute a try-catch block. Inside the try block, it calculates a numeric value using mathematical operations on the obfuscated variables from the a0_0x4da9 array. If the calculated value is equal to the second parameter passed to the function, the loop breaks. Otherwise, it invokes the shift and push methods on an array variable _0x3a3d55.

The exported setSearchFocus function selects an element with the id 'search' and calls the focus method on it, which sets the focus to that element.

The exported showClearTextButton function selects two elements with the ids 'search' and 'clear'. It checks if the length of the value property of the 'search' element is greater than 0. If it is, it removes the 'hide' class from the 'clear' element and adds the 'show' class to it. Otherwise, it removes the 'show' class from the 'clear' element and adds the 'hide' class to it.

The exported clearSearchText function takes an event object as a parameter. It prevents the default action of the event, sets the value of the 'search' element to an empty string, selects an element with the id 'clear', removes the 'show' class from it, adds the 'hide' class to it, and finally calls the setSearchFocus function.

The exported clearPushListener function takes an event object as a parameter. It logs the key property of the event object to the console. If the key property is equal to the strings 'Enter' or 'Space', it prevents the default action of the event and triggers a click event on the element with the id 'clear'.
