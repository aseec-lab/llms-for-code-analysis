This code defines a class called ToDoList. The constructor initializes an empty array called '_list', and the class has several methods.

The 'getList' method returns the '_list' array.

The 'clearList' method sets the '_list' array to an empty array.

The 'addItemList' method takes a parameter 'item' and adds it to the '_list' array using the 'push' method.

The 'removeItemFromList' method takes a parameter 'item' and removes it from the '_list' array using the 'splice' method.

The code also includes some obfuscated functions and variables. It uses a self-invoking function expression to obfuscate the code. The purpose of this obfuscation is unclear without additional context.
