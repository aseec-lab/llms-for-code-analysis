This code is a JavaScript module that exports several functions related to manipulating search results on a webpage. 

The first function, `a0_0x6105`, is a helper function that returns a specific value from an array. The function takes two arguments: `_0xe94284` and `_0x3f0efe`. It assigns the result of calling another function, `a0_0x5b45`, to a constant variable `_0x5b45d6`. It then reassigns the `a0_0x6105` function to a new implementation, which uses the `_0x5b45d6` variable and returns a value from the array based on the first argument passed to the function. Finally, it calls the newly assigned `a0_0x6105` function with the initial arguments.

The second portion of the code is an immediately invoked function expression (IIFE) that takes in two arguments, `_0x47df13` and `_0x3e58c9`. It assigns the result of calling `a0_0x6105` to a constant variable `_0x1db134` and assigns the result of calling `_0x47df13` to a constant variable `_0x110565`. Then, it enters an infinite loop and tries to calculate a value using arithmetic operations on the result of calling `a0_0x6105`. If the calculated value is equal to `_0x3e58c9`, the loop breaks. Otherwise, the loop continues by pushing an element from the beginning of the `_0x110565` array to the end. If an error occurs during the loop, an element from the beginning of the `_0x110565` array is also pushed to the end. 

The rest of the code defines four more functions: `deleteSearchResults`, `buildSearchResults`, `clearStatsLine`, and `setStatsLine`.

`deleteSearchResults` takes no arguments and deletes all search result elements from the DOM. It selects the parent element of the search results and repeatedly selects and removes the last child element until there are no more child elements.

`buildSearchResults` takes an array `_0x1c201c` as an argument and builds and appends search result elements to the DOM based on the provided data. It logs the input array to the console, then loops through each element in the array. For each element, it creates a result item element using the `createResultItem` function, creates a result content element, and appends a result image and result text element if available. Finally, it appends the result item to a parent element.

`clearStatsLine` takes no arguments and clears the text content of a stats line element in the DOM.

`setStatsLine` takes a string `_0x4e03ef` as an argument and sets the text content of the stats line element in the DOM. If `_0x4e03ef` is truthy, it sets the text content to "Displaying " + `_0x4e03ef` + " results.". Otherwise, it sets the text content to "No Results".

The code also includes a helper function `a0_0x5b45` that returns an array of string literals.

Overall, the code is a collection of functions that provide functionality for manipulating and displaying search results on a webpage.
