This code is JavaScript code that exports two functions: `getSearchTerm` and `retrieveSearchResults`. 

The first chunk of code is an immediately invoked function expression (IIFE) that takes two parameters `_0x2f6c58` and `_0x178d30`. It defines two variables `_0x47d19c` and `_0x2f62f3` and enters a while loop. Inside the loop, it tries to parse integers from several expressions and checks if the result is equal to `_0x178d30`. If so, it breaks the loop. If not, it pushes an element from `_0x2f62f3` to the end of the array using `push` and `shift` methods. 

The second chunk of code exports a function `getSearchTerm` using `export const`. This function retrieves an element with the ID specified by `_0x5f27cb` (which is a function call `_0x5f27cb(0xb9)`) from the document and trims its value. It then replaces multiple spaces in the resulting string with a single space and returns the modified string.

The third chunk of code is a function `a0_0x2479`. It takes two parameters `_0x2ed627` and `_0x155d64`. It defines a variable `_0x442bc9` and returns a new function. This new function takes two parameters `_0x2479dc` and `_0x4e3b10`. It subtracts 0xab from `_0x2479dc`, retrieves an element from `_0x442bc9` using the modified value of `_0x2479dc`, and returns it. This newly returned function is then assigned to `a0_0x2479`. 

The fourth chunk of code exports a function `retrieveSearchResults` using `export const` and takes one parameter `_0x39e776`. Inside the function, it calls two other functions: `getwikiSearchString` with `_0x39e776` as an argument and `requestData` with the result of `getwikiSearchString` as an argument. It then processes the result of `requestData` by checking if a property `query` has the value `'pages'` and if so, it calls the `processWikiResults` function with the value of `query['pages']`. Finally, it returns the result of `processWikiResults`.

The fifth chunk of code defines a function `getwikiSearchString` that takes one parameter `_0xc6c490`. It concatenates several strings and the value of `_0xc6c490` to create a search string. It also calls the `getMaxChars` function to get a maximum number of characters and adds it to the search string. It then encodes the search string using `encodeURI` and returns the encoded string.

The sixth chunk of code defines a function `getMaxChars` that takes no parameters. It retrieves the window's inner width or the document's body's client width and assigns it to `_0xd3cfb9`. Based on the value of `_0xd3cfb9`, it sets the value of `_0x6775de` to either 0x41, 0x5a, or 0x78. Finally, it returns the value of `_0x6775de`.

The seventh chunk of code defines a function `requestData` that takes one parameter `_0x58a279`. Inside the function, it tries to fetch data from the given URL using the `fetch` function and assigns the result to `_0x1222d6`. It then waits for the response to be converted to JSON using the `json` method and assigns the result to `_0x16fbed`. Finally, it returns the converted JSON.

The eighth chunk of code defines a function `processWikiResults` that takes one parameter `_0x359709`. Inside the function, it defines an empty array `_0x3554f3`. It then iterates over the keys of `_0x359709` using the `forEach` method and for each key, it retrieves properties `title`, `img`, and `text` from `_0x359709[_0x5007af]` and stores them in an object `_0x5de638`. This object is then pushed to the `_0x3554f3` array. Finally, it returns the `_0x3554f3` array.

The ninth and final chunk of code defines a function `a0_0x442b` that returns an array of strings. This function is immediately invoked and its result is assigned to `a0_0x442b`.
