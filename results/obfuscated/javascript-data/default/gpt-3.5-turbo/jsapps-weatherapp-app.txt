This code appears to be JavaScript code that fetches and displays weather information on a webpage. 

The code is split into multiple chunks, likely to obfuscate its functionality. Let's break it down and analyze each section:

1. The first chunk defines a function called `a0_0x36bc`. This function takes two parameters `_0x4ee48e` and `_0x3f2c4c`. It declares a constant variable `_0x4245ce` and assigns it the result of calling the function `a0_0x4245()`. Then, the function redefines itself to return the value corresponding to the index `_0x36bc54` of `_0x4245ce`. Finally, it calls the redefined `a0_0x36bc` function with the provided parameters and returns the result.
2. The second chunk defines a function called `a0_0x4245` which returns an array of strings. It declares a constant variable `_0x4811f6` and assigns it an array of strings. It then redefines `a0_0x4245` to return `_0x4811f6` and calls the function immediately. The returned array of strings is used in other parts of the code.
3. The third chunk defines a function that takes two parameters `_0x3277d8` and `_0x1b1a5d`. It declares a constant variable `_0x2c0bae` and assigns it the value of the redefined `a0_0x36bc` function. It then declares `_0x1ec131` and assigns it the result of calling `_0x3277d8()`. Inside a while loop, it tries to parse and calculate the value of `_0x3cb485` by performing arithmetic operations on multiple `parseInt` calls with the strings obtained from `_0x2c0mbae`. If the calculated value is equal to `_0x1b1a5d`, the loop breaks. Otherwise, it shifts the first element of `_0x1ec131` array and pushes it to the array.
4. The fourth chunk defines an immediately invoked function expression (IIFE). Inside the IIFE, it declares several variables (`_0x1255b8`, `_0x597d6d`, `_0x152803`, `_0xf32e`, `_0x303092`, `_0x4a6f1a`, `_0x8b9a6e`). It uses the `querySelector` method to select the appropriate HTML elements from the document. It then checks if the `navigator.geolocation` object is available and calls the `getCurrentPosition` method, passing a callback function. In the callback function, it assigns the latitude and longitude values from the obtained position to variables `_0x1255b8` and `_0x597d6d`. It constructs a URL string using these coordinates and fetches the weather data using the `fetch` function. It then uses `then` method to extract the JSON response and another `then` method to process and display the weather information on the webpage.
5. The last chunk defines a function `_0x3b8e95` that takes two parameters `_0xbb2e90` and `_0x237608`. Inside the function, it removes any dashes from `_0xbb2e90` string and converts it to uppercase. It then creates a Skycons object and assigns it to `_0x2f670f`. It uses the modified `_0xbb2e90` value to set the appropriate icon on the webpage using the Skycons object.

Overall, this code fetches weather data based on the user's geolocation and displays it on a webpage using the Skycons library for icons.
