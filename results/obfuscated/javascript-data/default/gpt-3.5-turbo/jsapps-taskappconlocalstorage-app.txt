The code is written in JavaScript and appears to be a web application that handles tasks. 

Here is the breakdown of what the code does:

1. The first part of the code defines an anonymous function (`a0_0x4189`) that returns an array of strings `_0x3b090c`.
2. The second part of the code calls the anonymous function and assigns the returned array to the constant `a0_0x3c753d`.
3. The third part of the code is a self-invoking function that takes two parameters `_0x537957` and `_0x26c897`.
   - Inside the function, it defines another anonymous function (_0x25379a) and assigns the first parameter (`_0x537957`) to a variable `_0x30fd63`.
   - It then enters an infinite loop and tries to execute the code inside the loop.
   - The code inside the loop calculates a value `_0x156feb` based on some arithmetic operations using the array `_0x30fd63`.
   - If the calculated value is equal to the second parameter (`_0x26c897`), it breaks the loop. Otherwise, it shifts the first element of the array to the end and continues the loop.
   - The purpose of this loop is not clear without the full context or the remaining code.
4. After the self-invoking function, the code defines a variable `formTask` and assigns it the value of the element selected with the `querySelector` method. The selector is obtained from the `a0_0x3c753d` function.
5. It then adds an event listener to the `formTask` element for the `submit` event. The event handler is the function `saveTask`.
6. The `saveTask` function is defined and takes one parameter `_0x1bf58a`.
   - It calls the `preventDefault` method on the `_0x1bf58a` parameter to prevent the default form submission behavior.
   - It selects two elements using `querySelector` and assigns their values to `_0x3809a1` and `_0x215d20` variables.
   - It checks if the `_0x3809a1` variable is an empty string, and if so, it calls the `inputEmpty` function and returns false.
   - If the condition is false, it creates an object `_0x470dc0` with properties `title` and `description` assigned the values of `_0x3809a1` and `_0x215d20` respectively.
   - It checks if the `localStorage` has an item with key `'tasks'` and if not, it creates an empty array `_0x358fe4`, adds the `_0x470dc0` object to the array, and stores the array as a JSON string in the `localStorage` with key `'tasks'`.
   - If the `localStorage` already has the `'tasks'` item, it retrieves the stored array, parses it from the JSON string to an object, adds the `_0x470dc0` object to the array, and updates the stored array in the `localStorage`.
   - After storing the task, it calls the `getTask` function and resets the form by calling the `reset` method on the `formTask` element.
7. The `inputEmpty` function is defined and simply logs the string `'empty'` to the console.
8. The `a0_0x551a` function is defined and takes two parameters `_0x106d93` and `_0x11d072`.
   - It calls the `a0_0x4189` function to get the array of strings.
   - It defines another anonymous function (`_0x551a94`, `_0x5e4d92`) and assigns it to the `a0_0x551a` variable.
   - The anonymous function uses the obtained array to calculate the index `_0x551a94` and returns the corresponding string.
9. The `getTask` function is defined and has no parameters.
   - It retrieves the stored array of tasks from the `localStorage` and assigns it to the variable `_0x12da5d`.
   - It selects an element with the `querySelector` method and assigns it to the variable `_0x47d254`.
   - It sets the `innerHTML` property of `_0x47d254` to an empty string.
   - It then iterates over the array `_0x12da5d` and for each task, it retrieves the `title` and `description` values and creates an HTML string (`listItem`) with those values.
   - The `listItem` string represents a card containing the task title, description, and a button that triggers the `deleteTask` function with the task title as a parameter.
   - Finally, it inserts the `listItem` HTML string at the beginning of the `innerHTML` of `_0x47d254`.
10. The `deleteTask` function is defined and takes one parameter `_0x3ceee8`.
    - It retrieves the stored array of tasks from the `localStorage` and assigns it to the variable `_0x23c176`.
    - It iterates over the array `_0x23c176` and checks if the `title` property of a task object is equal to the passed parameter `_0x3ceee8`.
    - If the condition is true, it removes the task object from the array.
    - Finally, it updates the stored array in the `localStorage` and calls the `getTask` function.
11. The `getTask` function is called at the end to initialize the task list.
