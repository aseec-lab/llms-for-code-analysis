The code represents a JavaScript ES6 class named `ToDoItem`. A class is a type of function, but instead of using the keyword `function`, you use the keyword `class`, and the properties are assigned inside a `constructor()` method.

Here's a brief description of the code and its functionalities:

1. This class has a constructor with no parameters. The constructor initializes two properties (or instance variables): `_id` and `_item`, both of which are initially set to `null`. Each object instance of this class will have these two properties.

2. `getId()` and `getItem()` are getter methods. They get (return) the values of `_id` and `_item`, respectively.

3. `setId(id)` and `setItem(item)` are setter methods. They set the values of `_id` and `_item`, respectively, to the values passed in as arguments.

The purpose of this `ToDoItem` class is to represent an item on a to-do list, where each item has an ID and a corresponding item (probably a description of the task). The getter and setter methods are used for accessing and modifying these properties. The `export default` before the class definition allows this class to be imported in other JavaScript files.
