The code defines a JavaScript class `ToDoList` that uses WebAssembly (Wasm) for managing a to-do list. The Wasm binary is given in base64 encoding in the `__callWasmBuffer` variable and is used to create a Wasm module `__callWasmModule`.

`ToDoList` class has a private `_list` array that stores the items of the to-do list. This class has five methods:

1. `constructor()`: This method initializes the class instance by setting the `_list` array to an empty array.

2. `getList()`: This method returns the `_list` array.

3. `clearList()`: This method clear the `_list` array by setting it to an empty array.

4. `addItemList(itemObj)`: This method adds an item to the `_list` array. It creates a Wasm instance that calls a Wasm function which adds the `itemObj` item to the `_list` array. The Wasm function is passed to the Wasm instance through the `env.impFunc` import.

5. `removeItemFromList(id)`: This method removes an item with a specified `id` from the `_list` array. It iterates over the list to find the item and creates a Wasm instance that calls a Wasm function which removes the item. The Wasm function is passed to the Wasm instance through the `env.impFunc` import.

`__universalAtob` function is defined but currently not used in the program. The function attempts to convert a base64 encoded string into a sequence of bytes represented by a `Uint8Array`. If there is a failure (an exception during conversion), it falls back to using Node.js Buffer utilities.

Please also note that running this code in just any JavaScript environment (like standard browsers) will potentially fail because the `atob` function for decoding Base64 data, as well as `global.Buffer` method for Node.js, might not be universally available.
