This code defines a class called "ToDoItem" and exports it as the default export. The class has two properties: "_id" and "_item", both initially set to null. 

The class also has four methods: 
- getId(): This method returns the value of "_id".
- setId(id): This method sets the value of "_id" to the provided "id" parameter.
- getItem(): This method returns the value of "_item".
- setItem(item): This method sets the value of "_item" to the provided "item" parameter.

Essentially, this code defines a class for a to-do item with methods to get and set the ID and item properties of the object.
