This code defines a function called "__universalAtob" that takes in a base64 encoded string and returns an array of Uint8Array. 

The code also defines two base64 encoded strings "__ifWasmBuffer" and "__callWasmBuffer". It then converts these strings into Uint8Arrays using the "__universalAtob" function.

The code also defines an array "__wasmStringModules" which contains one base64 encoded string. It then uses the "__universalAtob" function to convert this string into a Uint8Array and creates a new WebAssembly instance using the module.

Lastly, the code defines a function "lS" that takes in three parameters. Inside this function, it checks if the parameter "wI" is an array or not. If it is not an array, it retrieves a string from the "__wasmStringModules" array using the "wI" index. It then decodes and returns the string. If "wI" is an array, it iterates over each element and retrieves the corresponding string from the "__wasmStringModules" array.The remaining part of the function initializes the app by calling several functions and setting event listeners.

First, it creates a new WebAssembly instance "__callInstance13" using the "__callWasmModule". Within this instance, it sets an "impFunc" function that listens for an event with the type "__universalAtob(0, 0)". When this event is triggered, it creates another WebAssembly instance "__ifInstance0" using the "__ifWasmModule". Within this instance, it sets two "impFunc" functions. The first function calls the "initApp" function and the second function doesn't do anything.

Next, it creates two more WebAssembly instances "__callInstance11" and "__callInstance10" using the "__callWasmModule". Within "__callInstance11", it sets an "impFunc" function that calls the "setSearchFocus" function. Within "__callInstance10", it sets an "impFunc" function that adds an event listener to an element with the ID "__universalAtob(0, 2)" and listens for an event with the type "__universalAtob(0, 3)". When this event is triggered, it calls the "showClearTextButton" function.

Finally, it retrieves the element with the ID "__universalAtob(0, 4)" and adds an event listener to it with the type "__universalAtob(0, 5)". When this event is triggered, it calls the "clearSearchText" function.The remaining part of the code initializes the event listeners and functions for processing and submitting a search.

First, it creates a new WebAssembly instance "__callInstance9" using "__callWasmModule". Within this instance, it sets an "impFunc" function that adds an event listener to the "clear" element and listens for an event with the type "lS(0, 6)". When this event is triggered, it calls the "clearPushListener" function.

Next, it retrieves the "form" element and adds an event listener to it with the type "lS(0, 7)". When this event is triggered, it calls the "submitSearch" function.

The "submitSearch" function takes an event object as a parameter. Within the function, it creates several WebAssembly instances using "__callWasmModule". Each instance sets an "impFunc" function that performs a specific action when called. These actions include preventing the default behavior of the event, deleting search results, processing the search, and setting the search focus.

The "processSearch" function is an asynchronous function that creates a WebAssembly instance "__callInstance2" using "__callWasmModule". Within this instance, it sets an "impFunc" function that calls the "clearStatsLine" function.

Note: The actual implementation of the functions and event listeners is not shown in the provided code.The remaining part of the code continues with the implementation of the "submitSearch" function.

After retrieving the search term using the "getSearchTerm" function, it checks if the search term is an empty string. If it is, the function returns and does not proceed further.

If the search term is not empty, it retrieves the search results using the "retrieveSearchResults" function.

Within an anonymous function, it creates a WebAssembly instance "__ifInstance1" using "__ifWasmModule". Within this instance, it sets an "impFunc1" function that calls another anonymous function. This anonymous function creates a WebAssembly instance "__callInstance1" using "__callWasmModule". Within this instance, it sets an "impFunc" function that calls the "buildSearchResults" function, passing the resultArray as an argument.

The "__exports" object obtained from the "__callInstance1" instance is returned.

Another anonymous function creates a WebAssembly instance "__callInstance0" using "__callWasmModule". Within this instance, it sets an "impFunc" function that calls the "setStatsLine" function, passing the length of the resultArray as an argument.

The "__exports" object obtained from the "__callInstance0" instance is returned.

The "submitSearch" function does not return any value explicitly, so it implicitly returns "undefined".
