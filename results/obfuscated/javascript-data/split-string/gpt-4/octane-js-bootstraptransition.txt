This JavaScript code is a bit obscure due to the use of hexadecimal nomenclature and nested functions, but by analyzing closely, we can see some of its operations:

1. It contains an array `_0x50fd17` with a list of coded strings.

2. There are multiple nested and self-invoking functions; these seem to be managing the obscuring and un-obscuring of the data in that array.

3. The function `a0_0x2f72` appears to obscure the data from the array by converting the index from hexadecimal to decimal, then adjusting that index to get the desired array value.

4. This function appears to be managing the shifting and pushing of elements in the `_0x4ca4f5` array until the calculated function `_0x4440ff` equals the passed in `_0x53e7be`.

5. The last wrapped function seems to be adding a `transition` property to jQuery's `support` property only if a series of browser-specific transition CSS properties exists.

Finally, the function is being invoked with `window[a0_0x3bab63(0x1da)]`, which seems like it would be `window.jQuery`, i.e., they are using jQuery to manage CSS transitions in various browsers. The value of the transitions is obscured to protect against reverse engineering.
