The provided code defines and exports a class called ToDoList which can be used to manipulate a list of items. The class contains the following methods:

1. `constructor`: This method initializes an empty array named `_list`.

2. `getList`: This method returns the `_list` array.

3. `clearList`: This method clears the `_list` array by setting it to an empty array.

4. `addItemList`: This method accepts an item as a parameter and adds it to the `_list` array.

5. `removeItem_id`: This method accepts an id as a parameter and removes the corresponding item from the `_list` array.

The code is obfuscated, possibly for security reasons or to prevent easy understanding of the code. The variables and methods have been renamed using what appears to be a hexadecimal hash. Also, the code uses hexadecimal for numeral operation which makes the code harder to understand.

The preceding procedural code to the `ToDoList` class definition creates a hexadecimal-to-string mapping function `a0_0x50b3` and a recursive anonymous function that manipulates some hexadecimal numbers in a loop. It's unclear without further context what the exact purpose of this procedure is, but it may be related to the obfuscation of the code.
