This JavaScript code exports a class named `ToDoItem`, which acts as a blueprint for creating a to-do item object that can store its own _id and _item. Each to-do item has an id and an item. 

Here is a breakdown of the class and its methods:

- `constructor()`: Initializes two properties, _id and _item, to null. They can be set later using setter methods and accessed with getter methods. 

- `getId()`: Returns the id of the to-do item.

- `setId(_0x2447ce)`: Sets the id of the to-do item.

- `getItem()`: Returns the actual item of the to-do item.

- `setItem(_0x45b48b)`: Sets the actual item of the to-do item.

Before class declaration, there is obfuscated code. It mainly consists of two helper functions, `a0_0xe7b5(_0x14856f,_0x2f5327)` and `a0_0x5963()`, which seem to be performing some sort of encryption or encoding process using a custom algorithm. The obfuscated parts and their purpose would become clearer if the rest of the code or the data to which the code refers was accessible.

Note: The names like _0x14856f, _0x2f5327, etc., are hexadecimal. They are often used in JavaScript obfuscation techniques to make code harder to understand and prevent reverse engineering.
