This JavaScript code is basically controlling the functionalities of a media player on a webpage. Here is the explanation of some important parts:

1. It declares a function `checkPlaying` which checks if a song or video is playingâ€”action is based on whether the media is paused or not. When the media is playing, the source for the play button changes to a pause image/icon and vice versa.

2. A list of elements are fetched from the DOM. The elements grabbed include the song, play button, replay button, video element, a display of time, and some other elements presumably used in the media player.

3. The player has a sound picker feature; `sounds` and `timeSelect` both have event listeners for click events, and correspondingly set the selected song and time.

4. `song.ontimeupdate` is an event listener that triggers whenever the current playback position changes. The trigger function updates the outline of the SVG based on the location in the song/video, and displays the remaining time. When the song/video ends, it resets to the beginning and the play button image/icon.

5. `fakeDuration` is set to 600 seconds (10 minutes), which might suggest a default length for a media piece that does not otherwise have a length set. In the code, it is used for calculations of the player bar and the time display.

6. The first part of the code seems to be part of a decoding mechanism, as it performs operations on some obfuscated strings and numbers. The purpose of this decoding is not directly clear.
