The code represents a JavaScript implementation of the classic Rock-Paper-Scissors game. The game is between a player and a computer, and the winner gets a point each round. Score for both the player and the computer are maintained and updated.

Here's an outline of the program:

1. `_0x3dde66` function: 
    - References some DOM elements like intro, computer hand and player hand.
    - An event listener is attached on computer hand image which upon click removes the intro from the window and shakes player's hand.

2. `_0x4a9dcf` function: 
    - Creates a list of choices (rock, paper, scissors) and attaches a click event listener on player's options.
    - Upon click, it selects a random choice for the computer, shakes the computer's hand and reveals both the player's choice and computer's choice. 

3. `_0x1d283b` function: 
    - This function decides the winner based on both player's and computer's choices. 
    - The function also updates the scores of player and computer by calling `_0x6d36f4` function.

4. `_0x6d36f4` function: 
    - This function simply updates the text contents of the players and computer's score containers. 

5. `game` function: 
    - This function invokes `_0x3dde66` and `_0x4a9dcf` methods which essentially run the entire game.

This code also includes advanced JavaScript mechanisms such as closures and higher-order functions. However, the variable and function names are obfuscated which makes it a bit difficult to understand the program.
