The code is written in JavaScript and it's a simple task manager. It enables the addition, display, and deletion of tasks. Here's a detailed breakdown:

1. `formTask` gets a reference to a form with the id `formTask`. 

2. The `a0_0x5575` function is used to manipulate a given set of data.

3. When the form is submitted (i.e., when a new task is added), the `saveTask` function is triggered. This function prevents the default form submission, gets the `title` and `description` from the form, and saves the task in the localStorage. If there are no tasks in the localStorage, it creates an array to hold the tasks and then adds the new task. If there are already tasks, it just adds the new task.

   The tasks are stored under the key `tasks` as a stringified JSON.

4. After the new task is stored, the tasks are retrieved and displayed using the `getTask` function. This function gets the tasks from the localStorage, parses the JSON, and displays each task. It also includes a delete button for each task.

5. The `deleteTask` function removes a task from the localStorage when its associated delete button is clicked. It gets the title of the task to be deleted, finds it in the array of tasks and removes it, then saves the updated array to the localStorage.

6. The `inputEmpty` function logs a message to console if the task title is empty.

7. The `getTask` function is called immediately at the end of the code to display the existing tasks.
