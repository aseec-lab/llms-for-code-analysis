The given JavaScript code obtains the current weather forecast for a user's location.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the entire process:
1. The code obtains the user's geolocation coordinates using the browser's Geolocation API provided they have permitted access.
2. With these coordinates (latitude and longitude), the code makes a request to the Dark Sky API. The Dark Sky API is an external service that provides forecasting and weather conditions information given a location.
3. The response from the Dark Sky API comprises of various information including the current temperature (`temperature`), a summary of the weather situation (`summary`), and an icon denoting the current weather situation (`icon`).
4. This retrieved data is then displayed on the webpage. The `icon` is used as a parameter to another function which uses it to display an image that corresponds to the current weather situation â€“ this is done using Skycons, a set of ten animated weather glyphs.
5. A click event is added to an element on the page that allows users to toggle the displayed temperature between Fahrenheit and Celsius. 

Please note that this code might not work as Dark Sky API discontinued their service at the end of 2021.
