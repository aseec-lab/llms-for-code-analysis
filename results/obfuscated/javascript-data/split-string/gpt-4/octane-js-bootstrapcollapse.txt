This JavaScript code appears to be a part of a library for handling toggling of pages in a web app. In other words, it's a library for expanding or collapsing page content, which is frequently used in concepts like accordions and collapsible panels.

Here's a summary of what the disclosed code does:

- The code implements a set of functions and methods for collapsing and expanding elements. It seemsto rely heavily on jQuery for DOM manipulation.

- Thereâ€™s an initial setup of an array that contains strings including HTML tags, CSS classes and other value identifiers probably used within the main functionality of the code.

- The variable `_0x3e7c6f` is a constructor function for creating an instance of the library. It has prototypes that include methods like `show`, `hide`, `reset`, `transition`, and `toggle`. 

- The `show` method expands a previously collapsed element.

- The `hide` method collapses an expanded element.

- The `reset` method probably resets an element to its original size before it was expanded or collapsed.

- The `toggle` function alternates between `show` and `hide` based on the current state of the element.

- Lastly, a click event listener is also established on elements with a specific data attribute (`[data-toggle="collapse"]`). When such an element is clicked, the event target would be toggled between 'collapsed' and 'expanded' states.

Please note that because there's only a part of the code, there might be other functionalities and behaviors not covered in this explanation.
