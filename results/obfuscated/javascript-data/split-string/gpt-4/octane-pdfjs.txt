This is a code used for parsing and rendering PDFs in javascript. It uses some obfuscated and deprecated code, so its understanding might be a bit tricky. Here are the main parts:

1. It uses an immediately invoked function expression that seems to convert a bunch of hexadecimal values into an integer, speaks about a complex or obfuscated mathematical operation. 
   
2. It defines variables `pdf_file`, `canvas_logs`, and `PdfJS` which is a new benchmark suite (likely a performance testing module).

3. It defines a series of functions `setupPdfJS`, `runPdfJS`, `tearDownPdfJS`, `buffer`, and `hash`. They work together, likely for setting up and tearing down an environment for displaying PDFs, buffering those PDFs, and hashing some part of the data for security or performance reasons.

4. It modifies the benchmark suite (`PdfJS`) object to have a `Benchmark` object. The `Benchmark` object represents a PDF viewer, it has the `runPdfJS`, `setupPdfJS`, and `tearDownPdfJS` functions as parameters.

5. It lumps a bunch of functionality of a virtual canvas into the `PdfJS_window` object. This includes base64 encoding and decoding, XMLHttpRequest functionality and many others to mimic a browser-like environment.

6. `PdfJS_windowInstall` is used to add new functions or variables to `PdfJS_window`.

7. In the end, it creates an environment for running and testing PDF.js, which is a Portable Document Format (PDF) viewer that is built with HTML5.##########
