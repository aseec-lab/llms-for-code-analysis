This code appears to define a class called ToDoList. 

The constructor function initializes an empty array stored in the property `_list` of the class instance.

The class also includes several methods:

- `getList()` returns the `_list` property, which contains the items in the to-do list.
- `clearList()` sets the `_list` property to an empty array.
- `addItemList()` adds an item to the `_list` array.
- `removeItem()` removes an item from the `_list` array based on the provided parameter.

The code at the beginning seems to define and set some constant variables and functions but it's hard to determine what they are used for without the complete code.
