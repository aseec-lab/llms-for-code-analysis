The code defines several functions and variables related to drawing animations on a canvas. 

The first function, a0_0x8088, returns an array of strings containing various CSS properties and canvas methods.

The second function, a0_0x1ffc, takes two parameters and returns a value from the array returned by the previous function based on the values of the parameters.

The next code block checks for the availability of requestAnimationFrame and cancelAnimationFrame in the browser and assigns them to the variables _0x3793bd and _0x252baf, respectively, if they are available. Otherwise, it falls back to using setInterval and clearInterval.

The following variables store values related to the animation, such as duration, speed, and angle calculations.

The _0x4c363e function draws a filled circle on the canvas.

The _0x386502 function draws a line on the canvas.

The _0x362b8c function draws multiple connected circles on the canvas.

The _0x3deb9a function uses the previous drawing functions to create a cloud-like shape.

The _0x1b697d function uses the previous drawing functions to create a raindrop-like shape.

The _0x4fef81 function uses the previous drawing functions to create a snowflake-like shape.

The _0x4ccc36 function uses the previous drawing functions to create a wind-like shape.##########
