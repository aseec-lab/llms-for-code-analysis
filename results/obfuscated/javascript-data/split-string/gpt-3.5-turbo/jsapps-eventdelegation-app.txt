The code appears to be a JavaScript code that adds event listeners to buttons and performs certain actions based on the button clicked.

In the first chunk of code, a self-invoking function is defined. It takes two parameters: `_0x23161f` and `_0x4bc0c4`. Inside the function, there is a while loop that runs indefinitely. Inside the loop, there is a try-catch block. The try block performs a series of calculations using the `parseInt` function with different values and operators. If the result of these calculations equals the value of `_0x4bc0c4`, the loop is broken. If not, the `push` and `shift` methods are called on the `_0xa9233d` array. The catch block also calls the `push` and `shift` methods on the `_0xa9233d` array. This chunk of code seems to be a form of obfuscation or anti-analysis technique to make the code harder to understand.

In the second chunk of code, three variables `btnBotones`, `botones`, and `fondo` are declared and assigned with the results of querying the DOM for certain elements using `document.querySelector` method. These elements are selected based on the concatenation of strings in the `a0_0x59ae7b` function.

Next, there is a `agregarBotones` function declared. Inside this function, an event listener is added to the `btnBotones` element, using the `addEventListener` method with the `click` event and the `agregarBotones` function as the callback. Another event listener is added to the `botones` element, using the same method with the `click` event and the `delegacion` function as the callback.

Then, there is a self-invoking function that contains the code to be executed when the event listeners are triggered. Inside this function, there is a switch statement that checks the value of the `target` property of the event object passed as an argument to the `delegacion` function. Depending on the value of the `target` property, the `fondo` element's `className` property is modified to change the background color.

Overall, the code sets up event listeners on buttons and performs actions based on the button clicked to change the background color of an element.
