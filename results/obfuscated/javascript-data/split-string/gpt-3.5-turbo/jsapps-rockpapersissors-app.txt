This code appears to be a JavaScript game that allows the user to play rock-paper-scissors against the computer. 

The code is split into multiple chunks. The first chunk defines a function called `a0_0x3694` which returns an array of strings. The function is immediately invoked and assigned to the variable `a0_0x3694`.

The second chunk is a self-invoking function that takes two arguments `_0xeb2fa4` and `_0x4b70f3`. The function declares a constant `_0xa4efef` and assigns it the result of calling `a0_0x2efd` (which is the first element of the `a0_0x3694` array), and then declares a variable `_0xbf3936` and assigns it the result of calling `_0xeb2fa4`. 

Inside a while loop, the code tries to parse some mathematical expression. If the result of the expression is equal to `_0x4b70f3` (the second argument passed to the function), then the loop is terminated. Otherwise, the code shifts the first element of the `_0xbf3936` array and pushes it to the end of the array. 

The third chunk defines a function `a0_0x2efd` that takes two arguments `_0x2d10a5` and `_0x44715f`. The function returns a value based on the index of the array `a0_0x3694` calculated using the `_0x2d10a5` argument.

The fourth chunk defines a function `game` that uses various DOM methods to select elements from the HTML document. Inside the `game` function, there are two main functions: `_0x3dde66` and `_0x4a9dcf`.

The `_0x3dde66` function selects certain elements and adds an event listener to one of them. When the event is triggered, it adds and removes certain classes from certain elements.

The `_0x4a9dcf` function selects more elements and adds event listeners to them. When the events are triggered, the function performs a series of operations and manipulates the DOM based on the choices made by the user and the randomly generated choice by the computer.

The `_0x1d283b` function is called within `_0x4a9dcf` and compares the choices made by the user and the computer to determine the winner. The function then updates the text content of an element to display the winner.

The `_0x6d36f4` function is also called within `_0x4a9dcf` and updates the text content of elements to display the scores of the player and the computer.

Finally, the `game` function is invoked at the end.
