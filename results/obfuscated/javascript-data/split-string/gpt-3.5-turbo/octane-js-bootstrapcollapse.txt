This code appears to be a minified version of a JavaScript plugin that adds collapse functionality to HTML elements. The code defines a function called a0_0x15ee that returns an array of string literals. Another function called a0_0x2c82 is defined, which takes two arguments and returns a value based on the a0_0x15ee function.

Next, a self-invoking anonymous function is defined. Inside this function, there is a variable declaration for _0x3e7c6f, which is assigned a function expression. This function serves as the constructor for the collapse plugin. It takes two arguments, _0x413f91 and _0x5a4dc0, and initializes the plugin accordingly.

The prototype of the _0x3e7c6f object is then defined. It contains several methods, such as dimension, show, hide, reset, and toggle, which handle the different collapse functionality. These methods manipulate the HTML elements associated with the collapse plugin.

Finally, the collapse plugin is attached to the jQuery library as a new function called collapse. It can be invoked with various options to toggle, show, hide, or reset the collapse functionality. The plugin is also initialized when certain events are triggered on specific HTML elements.

Overall, this code defines a collapse plugin that can be used to toggle the visibility of HTML elements on a webpage.
