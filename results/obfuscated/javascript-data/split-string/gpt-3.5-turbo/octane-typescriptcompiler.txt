This code appears to define several objects and their properties and values. 

In the first chunk of code, a variable `a0_0x28ec4e` is declared and assigned the value of `a0_0x20d1`. The code then executes an anonymous function that takes two parameters `_0x245660` and `_0x2adc3a`. Inside the function, a variable `_0x286b3e` is declared and assigned the value of `a0_0x20d1`. Another variable `_0x3a8bde` is declared and assigned the result of calling the function `_0x245660`. 

The function then enters a while loop. Inside the loop, the code tries to parse several integers and performs mathematical operations on them. If the result of these operations is equal to the value of `_0x2adc3a`, the loop breaks. Otherwise, the code shifts out the first element of the array `_0x3a8bde` and pushes it to the end of the array. 

In the second chunk of code, a variable `TypeScript` is declared and an anonymous function is immediately executed and passed `TypeScript` as a parameter. Inside this function, a function `_0x1e5a5a` is defined that takes two parameters `_0x304652` and `_0x389f17`. This function performs a bitwise AND operation between `_0x304652` and `_0x389f17` and returns the result. 

The anonymous function then sets several properties of `TypeScript` object. These properties include `None`, `And`, `Or`, `Xor`, `Ambient`, `Exported`, and others. The values of these properties are assigned as bitwise shifts. 

In the third chunk of code, a variable `_0x38a00e` is declared and immediately assigned the value of the `TypeScript.ErrorRecoverySet` object. 

In the fourth chunk of code, a variable `_0x387e21` is declared and immediately assigned the value of the `TypeScript.AllowedElements` object. 

In the fifth chunk of code, a variable `_0x1002fa` is declared and immediately assigned the value of the `TypeScript.Modifiers` object. 

Overall, this code defines several objects and their properties and values. The purpose and functionality of these objects is not clear without further context.In the remaining part of the code, several more objects and their properties and values are defined.

In the first chunk of code, a variable `_0x1b6dfc` is declared and immediately assigned the value of the `ASTFlags` object. Inside the immediately executed anonymous function, properties are assigned to `_0x271e47` object. These properties include `None`, `Exported`, `Private`, `Public`, `Ambient`, `Static`, and others. The values of these properties are calculated using bitwise shifts.

In the second chunk of code, a variable `_0x1851d9` is declared and immediately assigned the value of the `DeclFlags` object. Inside the immediately executed anonymous function, properties are assigned to `_0x72a88b` object. These properties include `None`, `Exported`, `Private`, `Public`, `Static`, and others. The values of these properties are calculated using bitwise shifts.

In the third chunk of code, a variable `_0xab59cf` is declared and immediately assigned the value of the `ModuleFlags` object. Inside the immediately executed anonymous function, properties are assigned to `_0x3cc026` object. These properties include `None`, `Exported`, `Private`, `Public`, `Static`, and others. The values of these properties are calculated using bitwise shifts.

In the fourth chunk of code, a variable `_0x8b4ac2` is declared and immediately assigned the value of the `ModuleFlags` object. Inside the immediately executed anonymous function, properties are assigned to `_0x53f0ff` object. These properties include `None`, `Exported`, `Private`, `Public`, `Static`, and others. The values of these properties are calculated using bitwise shifts.

In the fifth chunk of code, a variable `_0x502069` is declared and immediately assigned the value of the `SignatureFlags` object. Inside the immediately executed anonymous function, properties are assigned to `_0x3eac7d` object. These properties include `None`, `IsIndexer`, `IsStringIndexer`, `IsNumberIndexer`, and others.

Finally, a variable `_0x5c208b` is declared and assigned a value from the `SignatureFlags` object.

Overall, these remaining code blocks define several objects and their properties and values. The purpose and functionality of these objects is not clear without further context.The function `_0x385b23` takes two parameters, `_0xb614b8` and `_0x3f7194`. It declares a variable `_0x5d6486` as an empty string.

A for loop is then used to iterate through a range of numbers from 1 to 2^31. Inside the loop, an if condition checks if the bitwise AND result of `_0x3f7194` and the loop variable `_0x5bb4fa` is not equal to 0. If the condition is true, another loop iterates through the properties of the `_0xb614b8` object. If a property's value in `_0xb614b8` is equal to `_0x5bb4fa`, the property name is appended to the `|` separated string `_0x5d6486` and the loop breaks.

After the loops, the function returns the final value of `_0x5d6486`, which represents the names of the properties in `_0xb614b8` with values that match the bits set in `_0x3f7194`.##########
