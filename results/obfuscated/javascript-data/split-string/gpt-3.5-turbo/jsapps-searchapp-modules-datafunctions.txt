The code appears to be a JavaScript module that exports two functions: `getSearchTerm` and `retrieveSearchResults`. 

The first chunk of code seems to be a self-executing anonymous function that takes two arguments `_0x13aa6c` and `_0x1ec7aa`. It creates a variable `_0x8a760e` which is a function that will be defined later. It then enters into a while loop that will continue indefinitely. Within the loop, it tries to execute some code. If an error is thrown, the loop continues. If the code executes successfully, it checks if the result is equal to `_0x1ec7aa`. If so, it breaks out of the loop. Otherwise, it pushes the shifted value from `_0x3d7127` to the end of the array. It's unclear what the purpose of this while loop is without additional context.

The second chunk of code defines the function `_0x8a760e`, which takes two arguments `_0x35e2b1` and `_0xc8de13`. This function looks up a value in an array using the `_0x35e2b1` argument as the index and returns it. It then reassigns itself to a new function, effectively overriding the initial definition. This means that subsequent calls to `_0x8a760e` will call this new function that performs the array lookup. This is a technique called function memoization, which can optimize performance by caching previously computed values.

The third chunk of code defines the `getSearchTerm` function. It retrieves an element from the document by its ID and gets the value of its `innerText` property. It then replaces multiple consecutive spaces with a single space using a regular expression and returns the resulting string.

The fourth chunk of code exports the `retrieveSearchResults` function. This function takes an argument `_0x55754e`. It calls the `getwikiSearchString` function with this argument to get a URL string. It then makes an asynchronous request to this URL using the `requestData` function and stores the response in the `__161ec5` variable. It initializes an empty array `_0x4ebc27`. If the `__161ec5` object has a property named `__d8`, it calls the `processWikiResults` function with the `__161ec5.__d8.__f7` property and assigns the return value to `_0x4ebc27`. Finally, it returns `_0x4ebc27`.

The fifth chunk of code defines several helper functions that are used in the `getwikiSearchString` and `retrieveSearchResults` functions. It's difficult to determine their exact purpose without more context, but they appear to handle formatting and manipulating strings related to retrieving search results from a wiki.
