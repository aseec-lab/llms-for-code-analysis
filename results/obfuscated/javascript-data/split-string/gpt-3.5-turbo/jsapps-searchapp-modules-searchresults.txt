The code is a JavaScript module that exports two functions: `deleteSearchResults` and `buildSearchResults`. 

The `deleteSearchResults` function deletes all search results on a page. It first selects the element with the ID "search-results" using `document.getElementById`. Then, it loops through all the child elements of the selected element and removes them using the `removeChild` method.

The `buildSearchResults` function takes an array of search results as its parameter and builds the HTML to display the search results on the page. It logs the input array to the console using `console.log`. Then, it iterates over each search result in the input array using the `forEach` method. 

For each search result, it creates and appends HTML elements to display the result's image, title, and description. It creates a div element with the class "result-item" for each search result and appends it to the "search-results" element on the page.

The code also includes two utility functions `clearStatsLine` and `setStatsLine` for manipulating and displaying statistics on the page.
