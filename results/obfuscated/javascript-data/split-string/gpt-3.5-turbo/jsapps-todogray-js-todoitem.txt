The code defines a class called ToDoItem. This class has a constructor method that sets two properties, _id and _item, to null. 

The class also has the following methods:
- setId: Sets the _id property with the value passed as an argument.
- getItem: Returns the _item property.
- setItem: Sets the _item property with the value passed as an argument.

Additionally, the code includes an immediately invoked function expression (IIFE) that performs some calculations and pushes shifted elements into an array.

The code also exports the ToDoItem class as the default export.
