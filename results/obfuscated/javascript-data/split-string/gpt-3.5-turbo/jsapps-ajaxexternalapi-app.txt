This code appears to be a JavaScript function that fetches and displays data related to the dollar and bitcoin exchange rates.

First, there is a declaration of a constant variable `a0_0xf46f9c` that is assigned the value of another constant variable `a0_0x5b9c`.

Then, there is an immediately invoked function expression (IIFE) with two parameters `_0x40733a` and `_0x44bed8`. The function defines two variables `_0x4b9550` and `_0x1ed6cb` and enters a while loop.

Inside the while loop, the code tries to parse a series of expressions involving arithmetic operations and `parseInt` calls. The purpose of these calculations is unclear without further context.

If the result of these calculations is equal to the value of the second parameter `_0x44bed8`, the while loop breaks. Otherwise, the function pushes the shifted value of `_0x1ed6cb` onto itself. This creates an infinite loop.

After the IIFE, there is a call to `console[a0_0xf46f9c(0x1e6)](':D')`, which logs `':D'` to the console.

The code then declares and initializes two variables `botonDolar` and `botonBitcoin` using the `document.querySelector` method to select elements from the DOM.

Next, there is a function declaration `a0_0x201c` that returns an array of strings. This function is immediately invoked and assigned to `a0_0x201c`, effectively overriding the previous definition of `a0_0x201c`.

The code then adds event listeners to `botonDolar` and `botonBitcoin` using the `addEventListener` method. These event listeners call the `obtenerDatos` function with different arguments depending on which button was clicked.

The `obtenerDatos` function takes a parameter `_0x3e4eb6`, which is used to construct a URL. The function then creates a new XMLHttpRequest object, sets the method and URL, and sends the request. It also sets a callback function `respuesta` to handle the state changes of the request.

There is another function `a0_0x5b9c` that takes parameters `_0x38494a` and `_0xb61507` and returns a value based on calculations involving the `a0_0x201c` function array.

Finally, there is the `respuesta` function that checks if the `readyState` and `status` properties of the XMLHttpRequest object are at the desired values. If so, the function parses the response text as JSON and logs the result. It also updates the HTML content of an element with the id `'#resultado'` based on the received data.
