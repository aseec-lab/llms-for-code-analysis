This code defines a class called ToDoItem. The class has three methods: getId, setId, and setItem.

The constructor method sets the initial values of the class properties "_id" and "_item" to null.

The getId method returns the value of the "_id" property.

The setId method sets the value of the "_id" property to the provided input "_id".

The getItem method returns the value of the "_item" property.

The setItem method sets the value of the "_item" property to the provided input "_item".

The rest of the code (the part defined inside the immediately invoked function expression) is minified and difficult to read. It seems to be some kind of obfuscated code, possibly to hide its true purpose or prevent easy understanding.
