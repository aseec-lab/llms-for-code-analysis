The code defines a function called `filtrar` that filters a list of products based on user input. It creates an array `productos` with objects containing the name and value of each product. It then selects HTML elements using querySelector and assigns them to variables `formulario`, `boton`, and `resultado`.

The `filtrar` function is triggered when the button with id 'boton' is clicked or when a key is released after typing in the input field selected by '#formulario'. Inside the `filtrar` function, it clears the innerHTML of the element selected by '#resultado'.

It then loops through each product in the `productos` array and checks if the name of the product, converted to lowercase, contains the user input from the input field. If there is a match, it appends a new list item to the innerHTML of the element selected by '#resultado', displaying the name and value of the matching product.

If no products match the user input, it appends a new list item to the innerHTML of the element selected by '#resultado', displaying "Producto no encontrado".

Finally, the `filtrar` function is called to initially display all products when the page loads.
