This code appears to be a JavaScript module that exports two functions: `getSearchTerm` and `retrieveSearchResults`. Here is a breakdown of what each function does:

1. `getSearchTerm`: This function retrieves the value of an input element with the ID "search" from the document, trims any leading or trailing spaces, and removes any consecutive spaces. It then returns the resulting string.

2. `retrieveSearchResults`: This function takes a parameter `_0x18fa9f` and uses it to generate a search string for the Wikipedia API. It then uses the `requestData` function to make a request to the API with the generated search string. The response from the API is stored in the variable `_0x2d68aa`.

   - If the response has a property named `extract`, the function calls the `processWikiResults` function to process the results and store them in the `_0x58fd79` array.
   
   - Finally, the function returns the `_0x58fd79` array.

There are also a few helper functions within the code:

1. `a0_0x2a75`: This function takes two parameters `_0x3c2640` and `_0xd243d3`. It initializes a constant `_0x1b6bd4` with the result of calling the `a0_0x1b6b` function. It then returns the value at the index `_0x2a754f` of the `_0x1b6bd4` array.

2. `a0_0x1b6b`: This function returns an array of hexadecimal values.

3. `getwikiSearchString`: This function takes a parameter `_0x511494` and uses it to generate a search string for the Wikipedia API. It returns the generated search string.

4. `getMaxChars`: This function returns the maximum number of characters for the search query based on the current window width.

5. `requestData`: This function takes a parameter `_0x15e3c3` and makes an asynchronous request using the `fetch` function to the URL specified by `_0x15e3c3`. It returns the response from the request.

6. `processWikiResults`: This function takes a parameter `_0x380e25` which is an object containing search results from the Wikipedia API. It processes the results by iterating over the properties of `_0x380e25` and creating an array of objects with properties `id`, `title`, `img`, and `text`. It then returns the resulting array.
