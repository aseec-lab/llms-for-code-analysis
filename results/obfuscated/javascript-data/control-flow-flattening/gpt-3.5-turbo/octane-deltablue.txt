The code provided appears to be written in JavaScript. 

In the first chunk of code:
var a0_0x4363e8 = a0_0x3326
(function(_0x4ff83f,_0x7d2ec6){
   ...
}(a0_0x2d3d,0xcd2df))

This code declares a variable `a0_0x4363e8` and assigns it a value `a0_0x3326`. It then defines an anonymous function and immediately calls it, passing two arguments `a0_0x2d3d` and `0xcd2df`. 

In the second chunk of code:
var DeltaBlue = new BenchmarkSuite('DeltaBlue',[0x10246],[new Benchmark(a0_0x4363e8(0x106),!![],![],0x1130,deltaBlue)])

This code creates a new object `DeltaBlue` using the `BenchmarkSuite` constructor. It passes three arguments to the constructor: the string 'DeltaBlue', an array `[0x10246]`, and another array containing a single object created using the `Benchmark` constructor. The `Benchmark` constructor is called with five arguments: a function `a0_0x4363e8(0x106)`, two boolean values `!![]` and `![]`, and two numeric values `0x1130` and `deltaBlue`.

In the third chunk of code:
Object.defineProperty(Object.prototype,'inheritsFrom',{'value':function(_0x22a07d){
   ...
}})

This code uses the `defineProperty` method to add a new property named 'inheritsFrom' to the `Object.prototype` object. The value of this property is an anonymous function that takes one argument `_0x22a07d`.

The fourth chunk of code defines a constructor function `OrderedCollection` and adds methods to its prototype object.

The fifth chunk of code defines a constructor function `Strength` and adds methods to its prototype object.

The sixth chunk of code defines a constructor function `Constraint` and adds methods to its prototype object.

The seventh chunk of code defines a constructor function `UnaryConstraint` and makes it inherit from `Constraint`.##########
