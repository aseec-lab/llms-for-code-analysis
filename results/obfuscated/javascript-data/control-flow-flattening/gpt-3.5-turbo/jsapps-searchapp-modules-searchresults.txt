This code appears to be a JavaScript module that exports several functions related to searching and displaying search results. 

The first part of the code is an immediately-invoked function expression (IIFE) that declares a function called `_0x13cd81` and a constant variable `_0x41e4d0`. It then enters a while loop that tries to execute the code within it, and if an error occurs, it pushes the executed code back to the beginning of the array `_0x2123bd` and continues the loop. It does this until the condition `!![]` becomes false, which never happens, resulting in an infinite loop. This part of the code seems to be obfuscated and unnecessary for understanding the main functionality.

The code then exports two functions: `deleteSearchResults` and `buildSearchResults`.

The `deleteSearchResults` function does the following:
- It declares a constant variable `_0x35c103` and an object `_0x5b6ceb` with a property `LdIXj` whose value is `_0x35c103`, which seems to be a string.
- It selects an element from the document using `document.getElementById()` and assigns it to the variable `_0x293930`.
- It declares a variable `_0x492fe5` and assigns it the value of the `childElementCount` property of `_0x293930`.
- It enters a while loop that iterates as long as `_0x492fe5` is truthy.
- Inside the loop, it removes the last child element of `_0x293930` using the `removeChild()` method.
- Finally, it updates the value of `_0x492fe5` to be the new `childElementCount` of `_0x293930`, and the loop continues until there are no more child elements left.

The `buildSearchResults` function takes an input parameter `_0x2f3038`, presumably an array, and does the following:
- Declares a constant variables `_0x4fcb0b` and an object `_0x1032f6` with properties `zUmJz`, `VPqHu`, `qeUBC`, and `KiQfN`.
- Logs the value of `_0x2f3038` to the console.
- Iterates over each element in `_0x2f3038` using the `forEach()` method.
  - For each element, it calls the `createResultItem()` function with the element as an argument and assigns the result to the variable `_0x183231`.
  - It creates a new `div` element and assigns it to the variable `_0x2e6fb2`.
  - Adds the CSS class `result-content` to `_0x2e6fb2` using the `classList.add()` method.
  - If the current element has a property `d4`, it calls the `createResultImage()` function with the element as an argument and appends the result to `_0x2e6fb2`.
  - Calls the `createResultText()` function with the element as an argument and appends the result to `_0x2e6fb2`.
  - Appends `_0x2e6fb2` to `_0x183231`.
  - Selects an element from the document with the id `search-results` and assigns it to the variable `_0x262190`.
  - Appends `_0x183231` to `_0x262190`.

The remaining code defines three additional helper functions: `a0_0x3fa8`, `createResultItem`, `createResultImage`, and `createResultText`. These functions seem to be used internally by the exported functions, but the exact details of their functionality are not clear based on the provided code chunks.

Finally, the code exports two more functions: `clearStatsLine` and `setStatsLine`.

The `clearStatsLine` function does the following:
- Declares a constant variable `_0x598074` and an object `_0x3c5531` with a property `mtqFe` whose value is `stats`.
- Selects an element from the document with the id `stats` and assigns it to the variable `_0x2d69e5`.
- Clears the text content of `_0x2d69e5` by assigning an empty string to its `textContent` property.

The `setStatsLine` function takes an input parameter `_0x12ff67` and does the following:
- Declares a constant variable `_0x5a64ba` and an object `_0x3a26f8` with properties `vAZvZ` and `xKiAj`.
- Selects an element from the document with the id `stats` and assigns it to the variable `_0x2d69e5`.
- If `_0x12ff67` is truthy, it sets `_0x2d69e5`'s `textContent` property to the string concatenation of `_0x12ff67`, `Diplaying`, and a newline character.
- If `_0x12ff67` is falsy, it sets `_0x2d69e5`'s `textContent` property to the string `No Results`.
