This code appears to be written in JavaScript. 

From the provided code, we can see that it defines several constants and variables, and defines functions to handle different events.

The code is split into multiple segments and seems to use obfuscated variable names, making it difficult to understand the purpose of each specific line. However, we can still analyze the overall structure and logic of the code.

First, we have the definition of a constant `a0_0x52e6a9` and the initialization of a function `a0_0x51c9`, which returns an array of strings. The purpose of these constants and function is not clear without the rest of the code.

The next segment is a immediately invoked function expression (IIFE) that provides an implementation for a function passed as arguments. This segment seems to be some sort of obfuscation technique to prevent easy analysis of the code.

After the IIFE, there are various variable assignments, where the code selects elements from the DOM using `querySelector` and `querySelectorAll` functions, and assigns them to variables.

Next, there is a function `a0_0x326c` that appears to be used as a helper function for indexing into the array of strings returned by the `a0_0x51c9` function, based on the input arguments.

Then, there is an assignment to `fakeDuration`, and setting the `strokeDasharray` and `strokeDashoffset` properties of the `outline` element.

Afterwards, there are event listeners and callback functions defined for the `play` button and various elements in the `sounds` and `timeSelect` collections.

Finally, there is the `checkPlaying` function that checks if the `song` is playing and toggles the state of the `video` and `play` elements. There is also a `song` event listener that updates the time display and the stroke offset of the `outline` element.

Overall, the code appears to be implementing some functionality related to playing songs, updating time displays, and controlling the state of video and play elements. However, without a more detailed understanding of the variables and the specific functionality of each function, it is difficult to provide a more precise analysis.
