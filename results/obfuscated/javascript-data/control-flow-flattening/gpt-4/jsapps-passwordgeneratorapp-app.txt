The given JavaScript code appears to be part of a larger program that deals with generating, manipulating and copying strings or passwords. The code consists of several functions and behavior such as generating a string of characters, incrementing and decrementing the total characters count, elements selection and copy action.

Here are some specifics:

- The function `a0_0x732f(_0x4e7b1e,_0x135f33)` appears to be accessing an array or object `_0x26d036` at an index dependent on the parameter `_0x732f2`. 
- The function `a0_0x26d0()` returns array of strings that are later used in other functions.
- The anonymous functions inside the main function try to manipulate an array or list by shifting elements around based on their value comparing to `_0x18b9f7`. Some variables, like `_0x6c3186`, are transformed by complex arithmetic operations before they are compared.
- The code snippet in the second parentheses is adding event listeners to various HTML elements.It seems to respond to button clicking events with functions that increment or decrement the string length, enable or disable categories of characters (symbols, numbers, upper-case letters, lower-case letters) to be used in the generated string.
- The function `_0x32e380` generates a random string by choosing characters from a list, where the categories of characters (symbols, numbers, etc.) are controlled by the settings from the previous paragraph. The length of the string is controlled by the `'caracteres'` attribute of `_0x5a4164`.
  
Remember that this is obfuscated code, so the exact purpose of it may be hard to determine without the full context of the rest of the program.
