The provided code is partially obfuscated JavaScript. It appears to be implementing a "collapse" functionality, a common component in UI libraries such as Bootstrap which allows elements to be expanded and collapsed with a smooth transition effect - typically used for accordion elements, collapsible menus, etc.

Here's a high-level overview of some of the procedures:

1. The variable `a0_0x2774b9` is assigned a value equal to the function `a0_0x2969`.

2. Function `a0_0x2969` and `a0_0x38be` are defined. Function `a0_0x38be` returns an array made of strings which are seemingly random alphanumeric codes.

3. A self-invoking function manipulates some data (used for code obfuscation). This data appears to be encoded strings which get parsed and manipulated as per the recursive algorithm rules.

4. Subsequently, an anonymous function is defined and invoked with 'window.jQuery' passed as argument. Inside this function we have:
   - the `show` and `hide` in prototype is clearly implementing component's behaviours while showing and hiding states.
   - The `collapse` function is a jQuery plugin defined with default options and behaviours.
   - Event handlers are registered on the document to handle trigger of the `data-toggle=collapse` attribute on click events. 

It's important to note that due to the heavy obfuscation, making a complete and definitive analysis is not feasible. Many of the identifiers appear encoded, making it hard to decode them without the original code.
