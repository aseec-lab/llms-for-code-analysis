The given code is a JavaScript (ES6 syntax) program. The first chunk of the code is written in hexadecimal format and it's executed in a self-invoking function, using an XOR cipher logic. This piece of code is obfuscated and it's hard to determine its purpose right away without access to related parts, like a function or variable `a0_0x19d3`.

However, the rest of the code contains exported actions that interact with HTML: 

1. `deleteSearchResults` function: It selects a HTML element with an id provided through the '_0x35c103(0xd3)' function call and removes its child elements, thus deleting the search results.

2. `buildSearchResults` function: It performs operation on each item in '_0x2f3038' argument.
    * It logs the current item to the console.
    * It calls three functions directing data from the item:
        * 'createResultItem'.
        * 'createResultImage'.
        * 'createResultText'.
    * It then creates a new HTML element and appends the results of these functions to this new element. The new element is then appended to an existing HTML element with a particular id on the page.

3. `clearStatsLine` function: It selects an HTML element with the id 'stats' and clears its text content.

4. `setStatsLine` function: It selects an HTML element with the id 'stats' and sets its text content based on the '_0x12ff67' argument.

5. `createResultItem`, `createResultImage`, and `createResultText` are functions that create HTML elements and set some of their properties based on provided arguments.
