This Javascript code appears to be part of an application interfacing with the Wikipedia API to perform searches and retrieving result information. It appears to be using obfuscation to hide the details of the code.

Here is a high overview of what each function does as per the code shared:

1. getSearchTerm function: It gets the search term entered by the user and trims extra white spaces. It returns the final search term to be used.

2. retrieveSearchResults function: It communicates with the Wikipedia API to retrieve search results for a given search term. 

3. Function a0_0x1b6b: This function returns an array of strings. The purpose of this array is not clear from the provided code as the names of the elements appear to be obfuscated.

4. getWikiSearchString function: Constructs the Wikipedia API URL with the given search term and some additional parameters, and encodes the URL.

5. getMaxChars function: Determines the maximum characters for the query based on the window size (a part of responsive design). It sets different maximum character limits based on the window size.

6. requestData function: Sends a fetch request to the provided API endpoint and returns the result as a JSON object.

7. processWikiResults function: Extracts valuable information such as page id, title, image URL, and the article text, from the retrieved results and pushes it into an array which is returned.
   
It's worth noting that the overall purpose of this script appears to be a search functionality where user entered term is searched on Wikipedia and results are processed to be probably shown in a certain UI. But without the implementation details of the functions (due to obfuscation), the specific interactions aren't entirely clear.
