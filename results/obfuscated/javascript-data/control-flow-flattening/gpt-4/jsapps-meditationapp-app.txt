The provided JavaScript code is implementing a media player with an animated outline to reflect the player time and the ability to select different media sources. Here are some details:

1. A few elements from the web page are selected for manipulation, including a song/video, the "play" button, the "replay" button, an "outline" (typically a circle that wraps around the play button to visually indicate the elapsed/remaining time), a "video", different "sounds" (probably different songs/videos), a "time display", and "time select" (possibly the duration of the song/video). 

2. The `fakeDuration` variable is used as an initial time length, but it's later updated based on the selected media.

3. The `checkPlaying` function toggles between play and pause, it checks if the current video is playing; if it is, the function pauses the video (and changes the play button's SVG image to pause state), and if the video is on pause, the function plays the video (and changes the pause button's SVG image to play state).

4. The `song.ontimeupdate` is an event listener that updates every time the media playback time changes, it updates the outline and time display according to the elapsed time, and when real time reaches `fakeDuration`, it resets the song and video.

5. The media sources and corresponding videos can also be changed as there are event listeners for `sounds` and `timeSelect` that updates different properties (such as `src`, duration etc.)

Note: The code is written in obfuscated form, with functions and variables represented as hexadecimal strings for protection or to deter understanding of how the code works. This might explain the unusual naming of variables and constants.
