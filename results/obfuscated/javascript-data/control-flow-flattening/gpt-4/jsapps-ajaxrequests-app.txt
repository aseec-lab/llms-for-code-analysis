This code appears to be written in JavaScript, but it's obfuscated making it look complicated. Here's a breakdown of what it seems to be doing:

1. `a0_0x49b7` function: This function seems to be a closure used for variable obfuscation. It receives hex numbers as parameters, performs some operations on these numbers and returns the result of accessing the array `a0_0x1585()` at the computed index.

2. `(function(_0x2f4a87,_0x1993e7) {...} (a0_0x1585,0x60514))`: This is an immediately invoked function expression (IIFE) that executes as soon as it is defined. It seems to be using a while-loop to perform certain mathematical operations until a specific condition is met.

3. `function a0_0x1585() {...}`: This function is another closure that returns an array of specific strings when called. These strings are likely used further in the program.

4. `let boton =...`: This declaration is fetching the HTML element with the id which is fetched by `a0_0x1960d4(0x130)` and setting up a click event listener that calls the function `traerDatos` when the element is clicked.

5. `function traerDatos() {...}`: This function is making an asynchronous GET request to the URL `ajax-text.txt` using the `XMLHttpRequest` object. If the request is successful (HTTP status code 200), it logs the response text and updates the innerHTML of the HTML element with id that comes from `a0_0x1960d4(0x129)` with the response of the AJAX call.

Overall, the code appears to be setting up an event listener on a specific HTML element, and when that element is clicked, it fetches some data from a text file via an AJAX request and updates html content with the response text.
