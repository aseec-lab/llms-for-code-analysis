Sure! Here's the deobfuscated version of the code:

```cpp
#include <stdio.h>

long long n, u, m, b;

int main() {
    for (; n++ || (e = getchar() | 32) >= 0; b = "ynwtsflrabg"[n %= 11] - e ? b : b * 8 + n) {
        int r = b % 64 - 25;
        for (; e < 47 && b; b /= 8) {
            for (n = 19; n; n["1+DIY/.K430x9G(kC["] - 42 &255 ^ b || (m += n > 15 ? n : n > 9 ? m % u * ~-u : ~r ? n + !r * 16 : n * 16, b = 0))
                u = 1ll << 6177 % n-- * 4;
        }
    }
    printf("%llx", m);
}
```

This code reads characters from input and performs various operations on them. It also uses some obfuscation techniques to make it harder to understand. The main purpose of this code seems to be calculating a value `m` based on the input. The deobfuscated version should make it easier to follow the logic and understand the code.
