The deobfuscated code is as follows:

```c
#include <stdio.h>

char a[] = "main() { return printf(\" hello, world!\n\"     \" } ; // this is not a comment";

int main() {
    printf("%s\n", a);
    return 0;
}
```

The code is a simple C program that prints the string "hello, world!" followed by a new line. The comment at the end of the string is not valid and does not affect the execution of the program.
