Let's break down the code and simplify it step by step:

1. There is a variable `count` defined.

2. The `main` function is defined with three arguments: `argc`, `argv`, and `env`. `argc` represents the number of command-line arguments, `argv` is an array of strings representing those arguments, and `env` is an array of strings representing the environment variables.

3. The code checks if the value of `count` is less than 512.

4. Inside the `if` condition, a recursive call to `main` is made. The arguments for the recursive call include a complicated expression involving `argc`, `argv`, and `putchar`.

5. Let's analyze the expression passed to `putchar`:

   a. `(1 & (env ? (int)env : argc) | argc * 2)` - It performs a bitwise OR operation between `1` and either `(int)env` or `argc`. If `env` is not `NULL`, it is converted to an integer using typecasting.

   b. `putchar` receives the result of the above bitwise OR operation.

   c. `(count % 32 ? atoi(1[argv]) >> (7 & argc << !env >> !env + 29) & 32 < count | count == 16 ? '#' : ' ' : '\n') % 10` - This expression is the second argument for `putchar`.

      - `count % 32` checks if the remainder of `count` divided by `32` is non-zero.
      - `atoi(1[argv])` converts the second element of `argv` (as a string) to an integer.
      - `(7 & argc << !env >> !env + 29)` performs bitwise AND operation between `7` and `(argc << !env >> !env + 29)`.
      - `(32 < count | count == 16)` checks if either `32` is less than `count` or `count` is equal to `16`.
      - If the above condition is true, it returns `'#'`, otherwise `' '` (space).
      - The above character is passed to `putchar`.

      Finally, the result of `(count % 32 ? ...)` is modulo 10, which will be the second argument for `putchar`.

6. The `count` variable is incremented with `count++` outside the `if` statement.

7. The recursive call to `main` is nested inside the `if` condition.

To deobfuscate the code, we can simplify it by removing unnecessary expressions and formatting it properly:

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>

int count;

void main(int argc, char **argv, char **env) {
    if (count++ < 512) {
        int firstArg = (env ? (int) env : argc) | argc * 2;
        int secondArg = count % 32 ? atoi(argv[1]) >> (7 & argc << !env >> !env + 29) & 32 < count | count == 16 ? '#' : ' ' : '\n';

        putchar(secondArg % 10);

        main(firstArg, argv, putchar(secondArg % 10));
    }
}
```

Note: The resulting code may still have some unconventional logic and might not be functional in its intended purpose. Deobfuscating the code gives us a better understanding of its structure but does not guarantee its correctness.
