Sure! Let's deobfuscate the code and make it more readable:

```cpp
#include <stdio.h>

long long n, u, m, b;

int main(int e, char **r) {
    for (; n++ || (e = getchar() | 32) >= 0; b = "ynwtsflrabg"[n%=11] - e ? b : b * 8 + n) {
        for (r = b % 64 - 25; e < 47 && b; b /= 8) {
            for (n = 19; n; n["1+DIY/.K430x9G(kC["] - 42 & 255 ^ b || (m += n > 15 ? n : n > 9 ? m % u * ~-u : ~(int) r ? n + !(int) r * 16 : n * 16, b = 0))
                u = 1ll << 6177 % n-- * 4;
        }
    }
    printf("%llx\n", m);
    return 0;
}
```

The code initializes several variables `n`, `u`, `m`, and `b`. It then enters a loop where it reads characters from input until `getchar()` returns a negative value. 

Within the loop, there is another nested loop that performs operations on the variables `n`, `u`, `m`, and `b`. The operations involve bitwise manipulations and conditionals. The exact purpose of these operations is not clear from the deobfuscated code.

Finally, the program prints the value of `m` in hexadecimal format using `printf()`.

It's difficult to determine the exact functionality and purpose of this code without further context or information.
