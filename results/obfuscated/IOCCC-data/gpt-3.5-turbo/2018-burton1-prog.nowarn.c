Certainly! Here's the deobfuscated version of the code:

```c
int O;
char o[17];

int main(int l, char **v) {
    for (; ~l; O ? O : puts(o))
        O = (O[o] = ~(l = getchar())) ? 4 < (4 ^ l >> 5) ? l : 46 : 0 ? -~O & printf("%02x ", l) * 5 : !O;
    return !v;
}
```

The code is quite obfuscated, but we can still understand what it does. Let me explain the functionality:

1. `int O; char o[17];` - This declares an integer `O` and a character array `o` with a size of 17.

2. `int main(int l, char **v)` - The entry point of the program. It takes command line arguments `l` and `v`.

3. `for (; ~l; O ? O : puts(o))` - This is a loop that continues until `l` is negative. It prints the value of `o` unless `O` is non-zero, in which case it does nothing.

4. `O = (O[o] = ~(l = getchar())) ? 4 < (4 ^ l >> 5) ? l : 46 : 0 ? -~O & printf("%02x ", l) * 5 : !O;` - This is a complex ternary expression that assigns a value to `O`.

   a. `(O[o] = ~(l = getchar()))` - This reads a character from input using `getchar()`, assigns it to `l`, and then negates it. The negated value is stored at the index `O` in the character array `o`.

   b. `4 < (4 ^ l >> 5) ? l : 46` - This checks if the value of `l` is greater than `4` when right-shifted by `5` bits XORed with `4`. If true, `l` is assigned; otherwise, `46` is assigned.

   c. `-~O & printf("%02x ", l) * 5` - This bitwise operation bitwise increments `O` and performs a bitwise AND operation with the result of `printf("%02x ", l) * 5`. The `printf` function prints the value of `l` as a hexadecimal number with a width of 2, followed by a space. The result of the `printf` call (number of characters printed) is then multiplied by `5`.

   d. `!O` - This checks if `O` is zero and returns `1` if true, otherwise `0`.

5. `return !v;` - The program returns `1` if `v` is zero, otherwise `0`.

Overall, the program seems to be reading input characters, manipulating them based on certain conditions, and printing the result. The exact purpose and logic are not entirely clear without more context.
