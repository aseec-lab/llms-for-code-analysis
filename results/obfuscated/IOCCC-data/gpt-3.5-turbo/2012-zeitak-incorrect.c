Certainly! Here's the deobfuscated code:

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
	int i = 40;
	printf("%c", (char)(i));
	return 0;
}
```

This code defines a variable `i` with a value of 40. It then uses the `printf` function to print the character representation of the integer value stored in `i`. Finally, the `main` function returns 0, indicating successful execution.
