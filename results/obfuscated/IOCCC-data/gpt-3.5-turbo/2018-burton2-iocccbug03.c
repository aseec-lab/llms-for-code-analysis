Sure! Here is the deobfuscated version of the code:

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    printf("hello, world\n");
    return 0;
}
```

This code is a simple C program that prints the message "hello, world" to the console. The `main` function is the entry point of the program. It uses the `printf` function from the `stdio` library to display the message. The `return 0;` statement indicates that the program executed successfully.
