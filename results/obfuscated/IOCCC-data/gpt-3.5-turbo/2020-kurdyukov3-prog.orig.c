Certainly! Here's the deobfuscated version of the code:

```c
#include <time.h>
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>

int main() {
    unsigned a=0, i, j;
    int t[64];

    srand(time(0));

    while ((a = getchar()) != EOF) {
        if ((a >> 7 == 1) || ((a | 32) - 97 < 26)) {
            t[i++] = a;
        }
    }

    for (i--; i + 1; j = i ? rand() % i + 1 : 0) {
        putchar(t[i--]);
    }

    return 0;
}
```

The deobfuscated code uses `getchar()` to read characters from input until `EOF` (end of file) is encountered. It then checks if the character is either an uppercase or lowercase English alphabet letter. If it is, the character is stored in the `t` array.

After reading all the valid characters, the code uses the Fisher-Yates algorithm to shuffle the elements in the `t` array. Finally, it prints the shuffled characters to the output using `putchar()`.

Overall, the deobfuscated code reads a string of characters, filters out non-alphabetic characters, shuffles the alphabetic characters, and outputs them.
