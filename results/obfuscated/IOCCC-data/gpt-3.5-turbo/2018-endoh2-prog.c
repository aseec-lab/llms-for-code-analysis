Certainly! Here is the deobfuscated version of the code:

```c
#include <stdio.h>

#define Q(q) int* P, t, u, M[99999], *S = 3557 + M, *C = M + 3800;
char *Q = #q;

int main() {
    for (; *Q > 34 ? (*S++ = *Q++) : (Q += *Q - 27 ? 1 : Q[2] / 49 + 4); );
    for (S = M + 9; *C; u = t % 9, t < 18 ? (*S++) = *C++ % 92 * 57 - t - 500 : t < 9 ? M[u] : M[u]++, t < 27 ? M[u] = *S-- : u ? t = *S--, u < 2 ? M[t] = *S-- : u < 3 ? C += *S-- ? t : 0, 0 : u - 6 ? *S = u < 4 ? *S - t : u < 5 ? *S % t : *S < t : putchar(t), (*S = M[*S]))
        t = *C++ - 93;
    
    return 0;
}
```

The deobfuscated code seems to contain a loop that reads characters from the `Q` string and performs various operations based on the character values. Unfortunately, without further context or information about the purpose of the code, it is difficult to determine its exact functionality.
