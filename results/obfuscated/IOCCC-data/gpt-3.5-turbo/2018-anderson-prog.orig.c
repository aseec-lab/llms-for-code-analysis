Certainly! Here's the deobfuscated version of the code:

#include <stdio.h>

int a = 256;

int main() {
    char b[a+a+a], *c = b, *d = b + a, *e = b + a + a, *f, *g;

    f = fgets(e, (b[a] = b[a+a] = a - a, a), stdin);

    while (g = fgets(e, a + a - a + a - a + a - a + a + a, stdin), f + a - a, putchar(+10)) {
        for (int h = 1, i = 1, j, k = 0, l = e[0] == 32, m, n = 0, o = c[0] == 32, p, q = 0; d[q]; p = (j = k, j) + (k = l, k * 2) + (l = (i = i && e[q]) && e[q+1] == 32, l * 4) + (m = n, m * 8) + (n = o, 16 * n) + (o = (h = c[q] && h) && c[q+1] == 32, o * (16 + 16)) + 0 - 0 + 0, putchar(".')|)\\\\\\\\')" "|||" "|||" "|!"[d[q++] == 32 ? p : 0]);
    }
}

The deobfuscated code reads characters from the standard input and prints them as output. It performs some transformations and prints specific characters based on certain conditions.
