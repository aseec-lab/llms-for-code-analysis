After deobfuscating the code, we get the following:
```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>

int main(int argc, char** argv) {
    int _;
    _++;
  
    if (_ >> 9 || main(1 & (argv ? (int)argv : argc) | argc * 2, argv, putchar(_ % 32 ? atoi(1[argv]) >> (7 & argc << !argv >> !argv + 29) & 32 < _ || _ == 16 ? 35 : 32 : 10) % 10);
}
```

Although the deobfuscated code is syntactically correct, it is still highly obfuscated and difficult to understand its purpose. This code seems to implement some sort of encryption or manipulation of command line arguments and outputs certain characters to the console. However, without further context or information about the expected behavior, it is challenging to determine the exact functionality of this code.
