Certainly! Here's the deobfuscated version of the code:

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    printf("howdy!\n");
    return 0;
}
```

The code is now clear and without any obfuscation or unnecessary directives. It simply includes the necessary header file, defines the `main` function, and prints "howdy!" to the console.
