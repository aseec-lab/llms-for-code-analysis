Sure! Let's break down the code step by step to understand what it does:

```c
e,n,j,o,y;

main() {
    for (++o; n = -~getchar(); e += 11 == n, y++)
        o = n > 0xe ^ 012 > n && '`' ^ n ^ 65 ? !n : !o ? ++j : o;
    printf("%8d%8d%8d\n", e ^ n, j += !o && y, y);
}
```

1. Declare variables `e`, `n`, `j`, `o`, and `y` without specifying their types. This defaults them to `int`.

2. Define the `main()` function.

3. Initialize `o` with `++o`, incrementing it by 1.

4. Begin a `for` loop that reads characters from input using `getchar()` until it returns 0.

5. Inside the loop, update `n` by assigning it the value of the character read.

6. Update variable `e` by adding 1 to it if `n` is equal to 11.

7. Increment `y` by 1.

8. Begin a conditional statement that checks if two conditions are met. The conditions involve bitwise operations and comparisons with hexadecimal and octal values.

9. If both conditions are true, `o` is assigned the value of the logical XOR operation between `n > 0xe` and `012 > n`.

10. If both conditions are false, `o` is assigned the logical XOR evaluation between the characters '`', `n`, and 65.

11. If either condition is true, `o` remains unchanged.

12. If none of the conditions are true, `o` is assigned the value of `!o`.

13. If `o` is 0, increment `j` by 1, otherwise leave `j` unchanged.

14. Print the values of `e` XOR `n`, `j` incremented by 1 if `o` is 0 and `y`, and `y`.

Now that we understand the code, let's rewrite it in a more readable way:

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    int e = 0, n, j = 0, o = 0, y = 0;

    while ((n = getchar()) != 0) {
        o = n > 14 ^ (012 > n) && ('`' ^ n ^ 65) ? !n : (o ? o : ++j);
        e += (n == 11);
        y++;
    }

    printf("%8d%8d%8d\n", e ^ n, (j += !o && y), y);

    return 0;
}
```

This code reads characters from input until it reaches the end, performs some bitwise and logical operations, and finally prints the results.
