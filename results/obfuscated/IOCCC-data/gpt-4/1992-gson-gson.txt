This code appears to be a form of obfuscated C, intended to be difficult to read and understand, and possibly as a form of a programming competition or puzzle.

Due to its complexity and level of obfuscation, it is challenging to provide an exact explanation of what the program does. The code contains a mix of structures, arrays, and functions with single-letter names, all of which make the code extremely misleading and hard to comprehend.

This code is full of hard-to-read elements like missing semicolons, misaligned lines, usage of octal numbers, and many unnecessary line breaks and whitespace.

Here's an attempt to partially interpret this code:

1. It declares a handful of global variables: 4 arrays of long integers, a long integer, a pointer to an object of type struct 'f', an array of pointers to the struct 'f', a character array, and 2 character pointers.

2. It defines the struct 'f', which includes a pointer to another struct of the same type, thanks to which it is recursively defined.

3. It declares several functions, doing various arithmetic and bitwise operations. It seems like the functions gather data, do some calculations and display some results.

4. The main function takes command-line arguments and performs different tasks based on them.

Without complete context, exact use case or input-output analysis, it is virtually impossible to determine the exact functionality of this code. It could be anything from encryption to manipulation of some data structures. It might be helpful if more context or detail was provided.
