This code is a minimalist and obfuscated implementation of a Lisp interpreter, intended perhaps as more of a challenge or art form than a practical tool. Observable features and functions include:

1. Interpretation of a subset of Lisp language features including conditional statements, equality checks, mathematical operations and list operations.
2. Utilization of sbrk() to perform dynamic memory allocation (though note that the sbrk() function is largely obsolete and portable programs should generally prefer malloc()).
3. Implementation of several Lisp built-in functions like quote, car, cdr, defun, lambda and more.
4. Utilization of a stack-based approach to symbol resolution during expression evaluation.
5. Features a main function that reads Lisp expressions from the console, evaluates them and prints the result, looping continuously until EOF is encountered.

However, this code has several unconventional and less-readable aspects due to its obfuscated style. For instance:

1. The use of #define directives at the start to define common constructs reduces readability.
2. The code is formatted in an unconventional layout, making it harder to follow the control flow and function structure. 
3. It also lack comments, making it harder to understand its inner workings.
4. Variable names are mostly single character, which does not meet common coding standards for readability and maintainability.

This code provides a basic example of text processing, in which textual input is parsed, interpreted and evaluated according to a set of predefined rules. This can extend our understanding of how high level language interpreters are built using a low level language like C. However, this specific code is perhaps too obfuscated to serve as a good learning tool.
