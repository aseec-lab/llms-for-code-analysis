The code is a terminal-based game written in C language using the ncurses library. 

Here's what it does:

- The game is rendered in the console with an ASCII-based interface. It appears to be a more complex version of the classic game Sokoban. There are blocks ('C' in the data) that the player can push ('B'). Some blocks can be destroyed when pushed into certain directions ('D', 'E', 'F', 'G'), some others can be pushed into water tiles ('L'). 

- The player ('M') navigates in the game by using 'h', 'j', 'k', 'l' letters, mapped to four movements: left, down, up, right respectively. 

- The game grid, denoted by 'M', is defined as a two-dimensional array. The letters 'A' to 'N' represent different tile types. 

- The `while` loop contains the main game logic, constantly updating the game state based on user inputs. After each move, the game display is refreshed.

- The game ends when the player has made all the possible moves or if the 'D' count reaches zero. 

- At the end of the game, it displays "Well done!" if there are no more moves left, otherwise "Too many moves".

The structure of the code is complicated and might be difficult to understand due to the lack of commenting and unconventional variable names. Also, an ASCII game would probably be clearer if mapped to more human-readable symbols.
