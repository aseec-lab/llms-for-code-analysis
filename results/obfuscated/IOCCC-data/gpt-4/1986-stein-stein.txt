The given code, when appropriately compiled under an older version of C, generates a simple digital clock on the console (standard output), generating a timestamp every second with the format "HH:MM:SS".

Here's a breakdown of the code:

1. `typedef char*z` - Creates a new type `z`, which is a pointer to a character.

2. `O o _=33303285` - Declares integer variables `O` and `o`, along with initializing the variable `_` with a particular numeric value (magic number) used for calculations in the timestamp generation.

3. `main(b,Z)z Z` - Defines the main function with parameters `b` and `Z` where `Z` is of type `z`.

4. `(b>=0||(main(b+1,Z+1),*Z=O%(o=(_% 25))+'0',O/=o,_/=25))` - It handles recursive calls, and computes the characters which are going to serve as numbers for the timestamp.

5. `(b<1||(O=time(&b)%0250600,main(~5,*(z*)Z),write(1,*(z*)Z,9)))` - This part calculates seconds since midnight and recursively calls the main function with adjusted parameters to convert this time into the format "HH:MM:SS". Then, it writes the generated timestamp to the console.

It should be noted that this C code will not compile in the most modern compilers, because it doesn't explicitly state the types of parameters in the function declaration and recurses on the `main` function which is prohibited by the ISO C standards.
