The given code is seemingly obfuscated and not very readable, but despite its unusual appearance, it follows the syntax and semantics of C programming language.

Here's a breakdown of what this code does:

1. Certain parts of the program are defined through preprocessor macro, and several variables are declared afterwards. 
2. The code features funny and rather cryptic comments such as "Oh, be a fine girl, kiss me", "trolling is a art" or "END OF THIS ENTRY IS NEAR, SO NEAR". They don't seem to have any functional impact on the code.
3. Then, several mathematical computations and operations are executed.
4. The `main` function starts with several variable initializations, computations, and a `for` loop to alter the values in array `l`. 
5. It then uses the `localtime` function to fill a `struct tm` with data derived from a `time_t` object. 
6. More computations are done which modify the originally defined variables, while opening current file for reading.
7. It then outputs control characters to the console to manipulate the display.
8. Several computations and manipulations happen using various bitwise operators.
9. It features some code to read from a file using `getdelim`.
10. More computations and manipulations continue, incrementing, decrementing, and shifting bitwise values. 
11. Lastly, it prints some formatted string to console and returns from main function.

To fully understand the purpose of this code, it would need to be read and interpreted in its detailed context, which would require a deobfuscation and refactoring process. It's also worth noting that due to its level of obfuscation and lack of comments indicating the intended functionality, this could potentially be malicious code. As always, you should only run code from trusted sources.
