The provided code is written in C language but it seems to be incomplete or incorrect here are few issues:

1. There is a missing semicolon at the end of the declaration of the variables (`int x=3,n,m=2,*t,*a,*b=0`).
2. Variables `o` and `c` being used in the while loop are not declared.
3. There are not any statements named `N`, `o` or `c` in C programming. They are perhaps, undefined macros or functions, which are not given here.
4. The 'main' function does not specify a return type.

Given the code snippet, it's hard to definitively state what the code is intended to do, as it seems to be incomplete. However, in its current state, the mentioned code can't be compiled due to the aforementioned errors.

Please provide the complete valid code for a meaningful analysis.
