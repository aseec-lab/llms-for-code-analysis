This code is an obfuscated C program, which uses unconventional methods for space and readability to confuse developers or users reading the code.

The program starts with importing standard libraries stdio.h and string.h. The large block of braces is actually a multi-line comment (indicated by /* and */) and doesn't affect the functionality of the program.
   
The main function of the code is encryption and decryption, encoding or decoding user inputs based on some mapping rules, which are denoted by the function `n()`. Based on the value returned from the function `n()` which in turn uses function `b()` and `strchr()`; getchar(), putchar() and main() function, this program reads input from the user, transform it, and print it back out.

To understand it better, it's important to see how the encoding scheme works:

- The function `b()` translates the input into a digit by comparing the input character with a predefined string `"{ }\n*"` using `strchr`. 
- Then, the function `n()` translates the four combinations of 3 digits into different ASCII characters: ' ', '\n', '\t', 'a'-'z', and some others. 
- The program keeps reading inputs and converting them until it hits an end signal (a specific input that matches with the condition `b()!=6`.
  
It is hard to give the exact purpose of such a program without further context but this could be used in cryptology, or as a way to obscure information transmitted or processed in the code.
