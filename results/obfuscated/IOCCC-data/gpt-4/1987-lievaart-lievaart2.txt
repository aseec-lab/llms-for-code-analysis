This is a C program. It appears to be an implementation of a board game, likely the game Reversi (also known as OthelloÂ®). 

The program uses several preprocessor macros (`#define`) for various operations and conditions in the game. The macros appear to be designed to intentionally obfuscate the code as D, Y, R, e, I, W, etc. do not give any intuitive information about their functionalities. 

The game board is a 1600 cell array (`V[1600]`), but effectively, it's a 10*10 array wherein the edges are filled with the value 3 which represents out of board positions. Cell values 0, 1, and 2 likely represent empty, player 1's piece, and player 2's piece (or vice versa).

The `S` function seems to implement minimax algo or a variant, which is a common algorithm for decision-making in two-player games.

`E` function looks like an evaluation function which determines the possible valid moves for a player and makes the actual move.

The `main()` function represents the game-playing loop. At each turn, it accepts the player move as input until the number of defined moves reaches a certain limit (60). It also manages difficulty level by changing the depth of the minimax algorithm. This is an engine for an AI player in the game.

It's worth noting that the user input in this program may not be properly validated, which could potentially cause unexpected behavior or errors. Also, the code is pretty obfuscated and hard to understand due to the heavy use of macros.
