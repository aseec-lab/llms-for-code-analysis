The provided piece of C code is quite convoluted and not properly formatted, making it difficult to understand. It seems incomplete or basically invalid as it contains some invalid operations and ambiguous assignments in standard C programming.

However, it appears to be a console/terminal application that accepts commandline arguments (via argc and argv[]).

The main loop seems to be making some kind of manipulations on the start of the argument strings (**argv), including swapping values, incrementing values, and decrementing pointers. It also contains calls to putchar, suggesting that it's trying to manage and output some character data. 

But as mentioned before, the code logic is very unclear due to bizarre assignments and boolean expressions. For instance, the first part of the loop condition *argv != argv[1] && (*argv = argv[1]) effectively sets *argv to argv[1] if they are not equal, then the rest of the condition does not proceed with argv but argv[1] instead.

The code also accesses the argv array by the value of argc, which is problematic because argc is number of arguments supplied to the program and used as index might access out of bound.

This code is unsafe, unidiomatic, and nonsensical. It is advised to avoid coding in this manner. Proper indentation, variable names, and logical structure is necessary to write clear, readable, and maintainable code.
