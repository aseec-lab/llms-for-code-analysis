This program appears to be a text parser that reads from the standard input or a specified file, and writes the output to a designated file or standard output. It primarily does string processing with some specific rules to replace environment variables in the input text by using dollar signs `$`.

- It initializes FILE pointers `i` (for input file) and `o` (for output file) to the stdin and stdout respectively.

- It reads input from stdin/file line by line into buffer `y`, until it reaches the end of file.

- The `cb()` function checks for any occurrences of the dollar sign (`$`) which is usually used in Unix-like systems to denote environment variables. If it encounters a `$`, the program checks if this is followed by the name of an environment variable or by another dollar sign (`$`). If another `$` is found, then it includes this verbatim into the output buffer. If instead an environment variable is found, the program fetches the value of this environment variable using the `getenv()` function, and includes this into the output buffer.

- It takes and handles escape sequences (`\`). If after the slash there are some numbers, it considers them as a single number in octal form and makes a corresponding character from the ASCII table.

- It keeps track of the length (`l`) of output built so far.

- After processing each line, it writes the processed line from buffer `z` to stdout/file.

- Thereâ€™s also a function named `tng()` at the end, which appears to be unfinished or incorrect. The line `l <<= l >> 1;` represents bitwise operations for left shift and right shift, and results in some mathematical operations on the length variable `l`. But `strcpy(&D,"(C)1995")` is invalid and does not help in the actual execution of the program. The function doesn't appear to be called anywhere in the main program, hence, its purpose isn't clear. Also, note that the function has no return statement even though it is declared to return an `int` pointer.
  
Given the lack of comments in the code, some assumptions had to be made based on the given information. But based on the presented code, the above is a reasonable interpretation of what it does.
