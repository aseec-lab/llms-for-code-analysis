This is a cryptic piece of C code. There are several aspects that require ample explanation:

1. `unsigned char w,h,i,l,e,x,y=10,z=10,E[256]`: all variables are declared in a single line. `w`, `h`, `i`, `l`, `e`, `x`, `y`, and `z` are unsigned chars with `y` and `z` initialized to 10, and `E` is an array of 256 unsigned chars. Note that, `w`, `h`, `i`, `l`, `e`, and `x` are not initialized.

2. There's a non-standard main declaration. `char *v[]` is the main function's input parameters equivalent to `char **v`, which holds the command line arguments, whereas `c` which is equivalent to `int argc`, holds the count of passed arguments.

3. `#define whi1e(j,k)  printf(j,k); fflush(stdout)`: This line is defining a macro 'whi1e' which substitutes printf and fflush(stdout) functions.

4. In the main code body, the while loops work on decrementing values. They seem to reduce the respective variables until they reach zero.

5. `v` holds the converted string inputs, which represents integer values. `atoi()` function converts the string argument to integer.

Without a clear context or comments in the source code, the exact purpose or the actual task of this code is hard to determine.

Furthermore, this code may not function properly or as the author intended as several variables are not initialized before being manipulated and compared.

It's also worth mentioning that this code does not conform to the best practice, in terms of readability or robustness, due its complicated and confusing structure and poor use of ambiguous variable names. Practicing a better coding style would benefit the maintenance and understanding of this code.
