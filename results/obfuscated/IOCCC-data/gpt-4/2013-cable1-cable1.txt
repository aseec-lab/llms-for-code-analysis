This code is written in C. It takes two parameters when called: an integer 'riguing' and a pointer to a pointer of type char called 'acters'. The main function then calls the 'puts' function to output the value located at a certain memory address. This memory address is computed using the 'acters' and 'riguing' parameters through a series of operations. 

However, this code uses undefined behavior and low-level pointer arithmetic in a way that makes it hard to predict exactly what it will do, because it depends on the specific memory layout and integer size of your system. It is also worth noting that such manipulations with memory are prone to errors and security issues and don't represent good coding practices. 

Lastly, the code is obfuscated (made intentionally hard to understand), possibly for challenge, amusement, or concealment of its real purpose.+
