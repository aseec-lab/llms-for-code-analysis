The provided code is a rudimentary ASCII maze game written in the C programming language.

1. It starts by including the required header files and defining several macros.
2. It then initializes the maze array ("q") with zeros and sets a random cell as the starting point.
3. The game keeps running until the "player" managed to escape (reached the exit cell), or until the player decides to quit.
4. The "player" is represented by x variable which stores the index of the current cell in the maze. The value of x changes depending on the user's input.
5. The game world refreshes after each action, and it shows "@" character at the player's current location.
6. The player can move using the 'h', 'j', 'k', 'l', 'u' and 'd' keys. 'u' and 'd' keys can be used to climb up or down, respectively.
7. The 'q' key can be used to quit the game.
8. At the end, the functions "nocrmode", "echo", and "endwin" are called to reset console settings back to their inefficiency states.
9. If the player manages to escape, the program prints "You Escaped!" as the output.
