This C code appears to be obfuscated, possibly as part of a code golf contest or as an intentional attempt to confuse the reader. It's rather difficult to understand due to unconventional formatting, use of bitwise operations, and implicit conversions. 

Despite the unusual style and structure, let's try to understand its high level functionality. Here's a break-down:

1. Firstly, six global variables are declared: `e`, which is a pointer to a `char`, `t`, which is an array of `char` with 366 elements; and `f`, `g`, `h`, and `i`, which are pointers to `char`. Additionally, `d` and `m` are declared as `char`.

2. Then, a `main` function is declared, the parameters`c, b` are representative of `argc, argv[]` in a typical main function. `**b` is a pointer to an array of pointers (which are usually strings, from the command line). 

3. A nested loop structure is created, but because of the unconventional style and obfuscation of code, it's pretty hard to give a clear purpose for these loops. It has conditional logic using ternary operators and performs bitwise operations.

4. Inside the deepest nested loop, `puts(t)` prints to the console. But the value of `t` is manipulated in the loop and conditional logic above.

5. At some point, the `atoi` function is called, which converts a `string` to an `integer`. It suggests command line argument processing.

Without more context or cleaning up the code, it's difficult to determine the exact purpose of this program. It is worth noting that code obfuscation is often discouraged in typical coding practices as it can make maintenance and debugging difficult.
