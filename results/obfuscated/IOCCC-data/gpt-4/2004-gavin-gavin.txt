This code contains a set of six functions defined using C macros and directly in C using the `int` and `void` return types, and it includes a variety of variables identified single letters. The functions seem to perform various mathematical manipulations, bit shifting, array and pointer operation, and console output operations. Due to the highly obfuscated nature of the code, it is hard to determine the purpose of each function exactly. However, below is a general description of each:

1. Function B appears to perform a sequence of operations involving bitwise shifts, comparisons, and calculations on an input variable 't'. It also seems to involve two loops which perform some array operations.

2. Function `_` involves some bitwise shift operations, array calculations, and manipulations, and also seems to involve two loops performing various operations.

3. Function `main` appears to be the entry point to the program with the if condition and loops that perform operations based on the conditions. This function checksum on some variables, and using the putchar function, outputs either characters to the console or the contents of an array. Finally, it returns 0, indicating successful execution of the program.

4. Function `o` primarily runs a conditional series of bitwise and comparative operations on its inputs. It also calls a function and modifies some variable values based on the function's return value.

5. Function `G` runs conversions on and performs general operations with its inputs and a few global variables. It also handles control structures such as conditional checks and loops.

6. Function `o` again carries out similar operations to the other 'o' function but handles different input types for the same parameters. It also performs some more specific operations in terms of bitwise manipulation and comparison. 

Again, due to the highly obfuscated nature of code, this is a very general explanation of what areas the functions may be affecting or manipulating, rather than exactly their purpose or role within a larger program.
