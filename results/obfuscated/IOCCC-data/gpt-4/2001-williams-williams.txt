The provided code appears to have been intentionally obfuscated for a competition, a teaching tool, or as a programming challenge. It's difficult to understand as it uses a mix of macros, X11 library functions, bitwise operations, and arrays to achieve complex functionality. However, some functionality can be guessed:

The program is a game that likely operates within an X11 window environment. The game progresses in levels (the variable "v" keeps track of the level) and it also keeps score (tracked by "S").

It's hard to deduce the exact nature of the game or what the controls might be because of the obfuscation, but it seems to involve handling events related to mouse clicks (as noted by XCheckMaskEvent function; xbutton.x and xbutton.y which are related to coordinates of mouse pointer).

It creates a window, responds to mouse click events and involves some kind of motion or animations on the screen (may be entities moving) due to the presence of sleep and usleep functions for timed delays, XDrawArc, and XFillPolygon functions along with their related parameters which are likely used for rendering graphics.

The function dL() seems to draw entities on the screen, possibly including responding to some kind of collision. The J() function is the game's main loop where levels are progressed, scoring is updated, and the game responds to user interactions. 

The function Ne() likely creates a new entity on the screen. The functions like nL(), hi(), M(), di() etc. are used to detect, initialize, manipulate, and draw entities.

In conclusion, this seems to be a primitive 2-D animation or game of some sort but due to the heavily obfuscated nature, it's hard to make precise determinations.The remaining part builds and displays the main window for the game. Here's a rough breakdown:

1.  `O i=2` - This line sets the integer variable `i`to 2. `O`is likely another macro for `int`.
  
2.  `d=XOpenDisplay(0)` - This line opens a connection to the X server for the display named by the `DISPLAY` environment variable. It returns a Display pointer or NULL if the connection attempt fails. `d` is typically a pointer to an X server connection.

3.  `w=RootWindow(d,0)` - This assigns to the variable `w` the root window for the screen, using the display pointer `d` and screen number 0.

4.  `R i--) XMapWindow(d,w=XCreateSimpleWindow(d,w,0,0,W,H,0,0,0))` - This is a loop that creates a simple window on the Xserver and maps the window, causing it to appear on the screen. It's doing this twice due to `i` being initially set to 2.

5.  `XSelectInput(d,w,4|1<<15)` - This requests that the X server report certain types of events for the specified window. 

6.  `XMaskEvent(d,1<<15,&e)` - This line syncs the application's sense of reality with the server and then waits for matching events, but ignores others. The application would block until events meeting the specified condition are found.

7.  `g=XCreateGC(d,w,829,&G)` - This creates a Graphic Context in the Xserver, which can be used for drawing graphical primitives (images, shapes, etc.) inside the window.

8.  `srandom(time(0))` - Seeds the random number generator with the current time.

9.  `J()` - Calls the function `J()`, which as previously mentioned, is assumed to be the main game loop.

10.  `puts(m)` - This probably prints a game over message or end game score/message at the end of the game.
