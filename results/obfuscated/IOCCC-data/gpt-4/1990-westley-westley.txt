The given code appears to be written in a form known as "Obfuscated C Code". In this practice, a piece of C program is written in a way that makes it nearly impossible to understand intuitively.

However, this code seems to be more along the lines of an intentionally cryptic piece of art rather than a standard program, as it is filled with unusual variable names, unconventional formatting, wordplay, and numeric literals among other things.

Overall, understanding the exact functional details of this program would require a comprehensive, line-by-line analysis and a deep understanding of the workings of low-level C. But, generally analyzing, the code seems to perform various arithmetic operations on character ASCII values, and it's likely that it might print or output some cryptic message or pattern.

Here are some noteworthy procedures performed in the code:
1. It uses "lie" and "charlotte" to hold integer and char values.
2. Executes a nested 'do while' loops where the 'not' value acts as a condition. This loop performs bitwise operations.
3. It seems to be using ASCII values, probably to print some message on the screen.

Again, an accurate understanding of this code would require comprehensive analysis and debugging due to its complex and obfuscated nature.
