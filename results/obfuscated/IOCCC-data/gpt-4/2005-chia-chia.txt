This code appears to be a combination of a rant against Java programming language and C styled code written in the format to mock Java. The C code has been twisted into a Java-esque structure by defining many keywords of Java with the '#' preprocessor macro in C. The code largely seems unfunctional. There may be some functionality hidden within the preprocessor directives but it's camouflaged by rant and the way it's structured.

It's clear that the writer was frustrated with Java's verbosity and features that they perceive as unnecessary. However, the code itself doesn't appear to do anything except vent this frustration. The actual functions of the code are obscured by the convoluted definitions and the somewhat childish style. It's worth noting that this code is unlikely to even compile, let alone run, in most, if any, C or C++ compilers.
