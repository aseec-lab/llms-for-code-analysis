This code is highly obfuscated and difficult to parse at a glance. Here are some general things we can note:

1. This code appears to fall in the realm of what is known as an "Obfuscated C Code". Some people write this to show the flexibility of the C language, demonstrate their programming skill, or sometimes to intentionally make their code unreadable such as in C Code contests like IOCCC (International Obfuscation Code Code Contest).

2. The `main(i)??<char c??(81??)??(81??)` line seems to be doing something with the argument to main (possibly representing a buffer that is then read into with `gets`, although improperly as `gets` is dangerous).

3. There are several function definitions with non-descriptive names like `M`, `U`, `R`, `Z`, `Y`, etc. Their functionality is hidden within the cryptic code making it difficult to apprehend.

4. The code often uses trigraphs (`??<` is `{`, `??>` is `}`) as a way to make it harder to understand. Trigraphs are sequences of three characters used to represent a single character.

5. There are some strings with non-alphabetic or cryptic characters at the bottom. What they stand for is unknown without further context.

6. Also, few variables names are written with single English alphabets and their purpose is unknown.

To summarize, while it's evident that this code is challenging and needs to be decrypted to understand its functions, without executing and testing and having deep knowledge about `obfuscated C`, it's nearly impossible to quickly tell what this code does.
