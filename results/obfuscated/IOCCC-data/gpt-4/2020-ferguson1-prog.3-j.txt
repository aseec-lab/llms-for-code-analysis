This looks like a game written in C, using the curses library for terminal-based graphical output. The code is quite obfuscated with the use of macros and some unconventional language features in C, making it not easily readable. 

Here is a high-level breakdown of the various parts of the code:

1. Includes: requisite libraries are included - curses.h for terminal-based UI, unistd.h for miscellaneous symbolic constants and types, time.h for time types, and stdlibc.h for general purpose functions.
2. Defines: various macros are defined which aid in creating the terminal UI and the game logic.
3. Typedefs and Global Variables: typedefs for size_t and unsigned long are created for ease of reading later in the code, and several variables are declared for use throughout the game logic.
4. Functions:
    - b(): seems to be used for game updates
    - E(): seems to end the game with a message
    - C(): function seems to be toggling an attribute off/on.
    - R(): function returns a random number in a given range
    - S(): function is related to gameplay, possibly related to player's score or progress
    - B(): function seems involved in game updates, possibly related to player's movement or position
5. Game Initialization: It sets up board, checks conditions (like screen size), generates random numbers for gameplay, and makes initial calls to functions for setting up the game state.
6. Game Loop: Handles player input for movement, screen refreshing, game updates, etc.

Due to the level of obfuscation in the code, exact details of the gameplay (such as the rules or goals) aren't immediately clear. But it certainly seems to be a terminal-based game.The remainder of the code appears to handle several different cases in your game, including event processing based on user input, game update rules, collision detection, and error handling/reporting. Here is an approximate explanation of some sections:

- It contains nested switch-case and if-else statements to handle user inputs like 'q' and 'Q' for quitting the game, movement inputs, check if the game continues or ends, etc. The spacebar seems to toggle the paused state of the game. It also seems to process movement based on the variable V.
- There are clauses that check for going over the edge of the screen (`if (Y<1||Y>=y<:-2:>||X<2||X>=*y||y<:-2:>>=y<: -1 :>|| *y>=1<:y:>){...}`), with handling for two different cases depending on the variables y and p.
- Collisions between the player and other entities seems to be detected in this part: `for(I=0!4<:p:> &&I <A ++I)if(Y == e<:I:>&&X==n<:I:>){ E(Z(OW!)) goto y }`.
- Picking up items or triggering game events seem to be handled in `if(Y== *V &&X==*U)B(1) else{...}` section.
- The last part looks like the cleanup and end of the game, most notably calling E, likely ending the game, and then freeing the memory for arrays e and n.

However, the exact details aren't clear without knowing the specifics of the rest of the program and what all the variables and macros represent. This is because the code does not contain enough comments or have self-explanatory variables and function names, reflecting a heavy use of obfuscated programming style.
