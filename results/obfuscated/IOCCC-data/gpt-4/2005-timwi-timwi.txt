The code you have posted is quite cryptic. It uses a lot of preprocessor definitions for obfuscation and makes excessive use of the ternary operator (`?:`) for further confusion. The purposeful lack of proper indentation, formatting, or comments also makes it difficult to decipher what the code does.

However, here's what we can observe:
1. The code contains numerous ternary operations. These are short conditional statements written as `condition ? result_if_true : result_if_false`. This is a way to compactify if-else statements in C.
2. It calls `getchar` function which reads a single character input.
3. It uses the `scanf` function to read an integer input, and the `printf` function to output integers.

Due to the cryptic nature of the code, without running the code or step by step debugging, it is not easy to determine in detail what it does. It is generally recognized as bad practice to write code in such a confusing and unreadable manner, as it makes maintenance and debugging very challenging.
