This code format is obfuscated and may be a complex task to understand, also, it seems to be incomplete or broken, containing some elements that don't fit together.

Let's break it down a bit:

1. `extern int errno` - This is a variable that is kept in the C library to record error numbers during program execution. The 'extern' keyword states that this variable is defined elsewhere, usually in a library.

2. `char grrr` - This is the declaration of a character called `grrr`, but it's not used in the given code.

3. `main(...)` - This is the main function of the program. It takes arguments like all main functions do in C but it's done in an unusual, unreadable way.

4. `int P()` and `P (a)` - These look like function declarations and a function call, but without the function body, it's hard to say what it does.

5. `#define x int i, j, cc[4]` - It seems to be a macro definition that declares three integers: `i`, `j` and an array of four integers `cc[]`. The formatting makes it hard to tell where `x` is used.

6. `printf(" choo choo\n")` - This line will print the text "choo choo" followed by a new line.

7. Following parts of the code warn with conditional, assignment and looping operations that don't read well because of the overall confusing formatting.

8. `_exit(argv[argc- 2 / cc[1*argc] |-1<<4 ] )` - This looks like it is intended to exit the program with a specific status code, however, it is unclear as the operation seems broken.

9. `printf("%d",P(""))` - This line, presumably, should print the return value of the function `P`, but it's hard to say for sure without seeing the correct version of `P()`. 

In summary, it's almost impossible to understand the actual functioning of the program due to obfuscation and broken/unfinished parts in the code. It's necessary to correct and format the code appropriately to understand and execute it better.
