This code appears to be written in the C programming language. It is quite obfuscated, difficult to understand and lacks proper documentation, which makes it harder to understand its full functionality. However, here's a rough overview of what it does:

1. At a high level, it uses the Xlib library, part of the X Window System which is a windowing system for bitmap displays, common on Unix-like operating systems.

2. The code opens a window pressing any key via XOpenDisplay, XCreateGC, XCreateSimpleWindow, XMapWindow, and XSelectInput functions.

3. The code runs a loop where it performs mathematical operations with trigonometric functions like sin and cos functions from the math.h library, calculates new positions for figures and streams of data that could potentially be visualized or animated.

4. The code accepts input via scanf function and can also draw lines on the screen via XDrawLine function and even draw text strings via XDrawString function.

5. It listens for key events via XNextEvent and performs operations depending on the keys pressed based on XLookupKeysym function.

6. It's also worth noting the use of the 'select' function which is typically used for monitoring input/output (I/O) requests to one or more file descriptors, to see if they are ready to be read or written.

Overall, the specifics of what the code does are hard to decipher without further context, additional comments in the code or knowledge about the specific use-case. The nature of the code suggests it could be for an application that requires graphics manipulation, possibly even a small game or a simulation of some sort.
