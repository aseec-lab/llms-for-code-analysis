The provided code is not straightforward and quite cryptic, but it appears to calculate and print out a particular pattern or sequence of characters based on the given format string, "fmt" and defined macros along with given array "d". These patterns or sequence of characters are generated by exploiting the functionality of printf function in C with program defined format specifiers. 

Here's a high-level summary of what the code seems to be doing:

- It defines a series of macros "E", "R", "O", "N", etc. that generate format specification strings that will be used with printf functions.
- These strings are then used to format data in a certain way, such as padding numbers with spaces, printing hexadecimal values, etc.
- The 'arg' macro is a large compound statement which references an array "d".
- Then, there is a character array 'd' initialized with values.
- In main function, it runs a loop that prints the formatted output for given "fmt" and using the arguments provided by 'arg', until the first element of array "d" is non-zero.

Without knowing the target platform, and without running the code, it is difficult to predict the exact output. The output will heavily depend on the interpretation of format specifiers and the value of array "d". It's also possible that this code might be using some kind of format string exploit depending on the system it's on. 

Moreover, this is a static analysis and may not account for all possible side-effects, secondary effects, or underlying processes that occur when the code is actually run.
