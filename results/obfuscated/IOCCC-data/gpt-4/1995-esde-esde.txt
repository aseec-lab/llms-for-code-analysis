This is a piece of obfuscated C code. This kind of code is often written to hide the intent or functionality of the code, or just for fun in code-golf challenges. Here's a rough breakdown of what the code does.

The code starts by defining a static character array `atoi` which stores scrambled characters. It is followed by defining few variables and arrays like `fgetc`, `rand`, `qsort` and `log`. 

Inside main block it checks if argument count (`LCL`) is less than 3, if condition satisfy it returns 1. It opens a file which name is received from command line arguments (if available). If the file doesn't exist, it returns 2. 

Further, it reads the content of the file, line by line in a loop. It loops over every character of the line checking if it's an alpha character and modifying the `qsort` array based on received characters. 

It also checks if `fgetc` array matches with `rand` array. If match found, it prints the entire line, otherwise it continues for next line. 

At the end, it closes the file and returns 0.

Finally, the program defines a function SD that works on two char pointers and does a series of operations on these buffers like bit manipulation, XORs, and other checks.

Due to the obfuscation, understanding the exact functionality is difficult without executing and debugging the code.
