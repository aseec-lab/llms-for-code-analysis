This is a complex piece of obfuscated C programming language. Given the level of abstraction and varied operators, it's not immediately clear what the code does. 

However, here are few things we can observe:

1. The code uses both preprocessor macros and C functions defined in this manner `'#define P *p'` or `'#define E (s?s-1?s-2?'`.
2. The code reads from a file and based on certain conditions, it writes into a file. The file name can be given as a command line argument.
3. It accesses and manipulates a large buffer `m[65536]`.
4. It has some form of time-dependent execution as indicated by `time(0)`.
5. The code also seems to deal with graphical terminal interfaces. It uses parts of the `curses` library which is a terminal control library in Unix-like operating systems that enables the construction of text user interface (TUI) applications.
6. This script seems to handle both keypress events and screen updates with the `getch()` and `mvaddch()` functions respectively.

Without more specific knowledge of the code's context and supplementary comments to break down the obfuscation, it's hard to tell the exact functions and purpose of this code.
