The program is an implementation of the game Minesweeper. The game uses the terminal as its user interface and is implemented in C language, using the ncurses library to draw on the terminal screen and time.h library for timing functionality.

It creates a Minesweeper grid based on the size of the terminal and places a certain number of mines randomly on the grid. It then allows the user to interact with the game by clicking on the cells to reveal their content, if the cell contains a bomb the game is over, otherwise it reveals the number of surrounding cells that contain bombs. The user can also restart or quit the game.

Here are some important details about the code:

- It makes heavy use of macros and bitwise operations to compact the code and for performance. 

- The function "main()" initializes the game, the ncurses library and the coloring mechanism. Also, it handles user inputs like mouse-clicks on grid, quit the game, and restart the game.

- The function "D()" is responsible for drawing the user interface and grid in the terminal.

- The function "F(I p)" checks the value of the cell and the number of mines around it.

- The function "K(I p, I f, I g)" is responsible for laying mines at the start of the game and for updating mine counts of cells during the game.
