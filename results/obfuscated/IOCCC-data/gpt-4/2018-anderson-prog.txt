This is a rather cryptic and hard-to-read obfuscated C code. On analyzing the given code both in parts and as a whole, it seems like the code reads text input from a terminal or a file and processes the given text in a somewhat complex manner and then prints out the result. The code does so by utilizing an elaborate method involving arrays, pointers, bitwise operation, and ternary operators.

- First, it creates three arrays (`b`, `c`, `d`, `e`) of size `256` each (assumed), with `b` being the main array and `c`, `d`, `e` are three sections of the `b` array each of size 256.
- Then, it reads input lines in a loop using `fgets`.
- Inside the main loop, it processes each character and sets multiple variables based on the processed data.
- Then, it builds an index into the string of the bunch of characters and uses this index to select a character to `putchar` based on whether the character at the index `q` is white space (32 is ASCII value for white space).
- The series of manipulations and condition checks on the characters represent a kind of encoding or conversion algorithm, which is very hard to define exactly without a defined input/output specification.

But, without the specific details such as how the input is given, what kind of input is expected, and what the program ought to do, it is difficult to present a very precise description of what the code does. Also, please note that the provided code has syntax errors like missing semicolons.
