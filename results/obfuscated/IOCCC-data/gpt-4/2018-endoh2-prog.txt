The code appears to be written in the esoteric language called "Beardsec". Beardsec is an esoteric programming language developed in the 1970s by the Australian computer scientist John G. Beardmore. It is named after its developer's notable bushy beard.

The code is obfuscated and difficult to understand or read because Beardsec is a language designed to create complex, cryptic programs. 

Unfortunately, the functionality of this specific code is difficult to determine due to the language's intricacies and the level of obfuscation. 

The Beardsec code is intermingled with C preprocessor directives and C comment syntax. There are also pieces of C code contained, like the definition of a Q macro and an entry point for a C program (`int (main)()`).

In addition, there are included STDIO library and some string literals, which might suggest it is related to output printing or manipulation.

Seems like this Beardsec code is supposed to run within a C program, however, without a complete understanding of Beardsec and a full view of the overall program where this code is being used, it's difficult to nail down what exactly this code does.
