This code is a somewhat complex and arguably cryptically written program in C. Due to the labels and "goto" statements, it's harder to analyze than typical structured code. Here's a broad view of what it seems to do:

The program takes one command line argument which is a path to a file (since the `main` function is implemented with two parameters namely `togo` and `toog[]` which represent the count of command-line arguments and array of command-line arguments respectively).

The file is then opened for reading. For each line of the file, the program increments a counter `oogt` whenever it observes the string "goto" in that line. 

When it's done reading the file, it prints out the total number of "goto" strings it has found and then exits. Therefore, the program essentially counts the number of "goto" strings in a file.

Note that the program lacks proper indentation and use of whitespaces, making it harder to read. Also, single character variable names and use of "goto" statements make the code convoluted. Better programming practices including self-explanatory variable names, structured control flow, and commenting could greatly improve the readability and maintainability of this code.

Moreover, the current form of the main function here is outdated and non-standard. The proper and mostly used form is `int main(int argc, char *argv[])`. Also, `malloc.h` is included but it seems like no function from it is used throughout the program.
