This is a simple C program that prints the string "hello, world!" followed by a newline to the console.

Here is a breakdown of each part:

- `#include <stdio.h>`: This line allows the program to use the standard input/output library in C which provides functions like 'printf' and 'scanf'.
- `int main()`: This is the main function where the program execution begins.
- `printf("hello, world!\n")`: This is a function call to 'printf' which is used to print the string inside the quotation marks. Here it prints "hello, world!" and '\n' is a newline character.
- Finally, the main function does not return anything that's why there is no return statement at the end. In C, if you do not put a return statement in the main function then the compiler automatically puts 'return 0;' at the end of the main function.
