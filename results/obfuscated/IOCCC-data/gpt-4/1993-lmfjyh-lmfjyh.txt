The given line of code defines a pointer to a char array and assigns it the value of __FILE__. 

In C++, __FILE__ is a predefined macro which is replaced by the name of the current file (as a C-string) that's being compiled. Therefore, the pointer '_' will point to the string that contains the filename. 

This could be functionally used to retrieve the name of the current source file for debugging, logging, error messages, or other purposes where the filename might be useful.
