Given the complicated and confusing nature of the provided code, it is challenging to identify its function without a clear understanding of the macros and obfuscated code.

The presence of the `time.h` and `stdio.h` libraries suggests the usage of time functions and basic input/output functions. The `stdlib.h` library is also included for general-purpose functions. 

The other visible portion seems to contain a large number of macro definitions with relatively unclear intents. Consequently, it might involve dynamic macro expansions that can only be interpreted when invoked within the code.

The level of obfuscation and lack of context makes it impossible to infer the overall functionality of the code. 

It's advisable to better format and refactor the code to increase readability and maintainability. You may use a pretty printer or code formatter, if available, to help with this. It is generally considered best practice to write clear, understandable code.
