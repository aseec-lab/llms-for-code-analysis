The provided code written in C uses a number of #define statements or macros to replace regular programming terms with more obscure ones. After translating the macros back into common C programming terms, the code presented would look like this:

```C
#define main
#define write
#define read
#define char
#define goto
#define for
#define if
#define 0
#define 1
#define unsigned
#define (write, read, unsigned)

main(){
    char _=0, __, ___, ____[4096];
    goto ______;
_____: ___ = 4096-1;
 _______:
    write(1, ____, __ = (_-1<___ ?
        _-1: ___));
    for(
        __;
        write(1, "\b", 1), __--;)

    write(1, " ", 1);
    if(--___)goto _______;
    write(1, "\n", 1);
______: if(_ = read(0, ____, 4096))goto _____;
}
```

This code is a simple file output program, where it reads data from a file, storing it in a buffer (____) then writes it to the standard output one character at a time until it encounters an end-of-file (EOF). 

The number 4096 is the size of the buffer. It's a common buffer size for such tasks, when we don't know how big the input might be. It uses backward navigation with "\b" and introduces a space with " " to format the output.

Moreover, note that the program will loop indefinitely unless it encounters an EOF because it checks if _ = read(0, ____, 4096) is true and if true, it goes back to '_____:'.
