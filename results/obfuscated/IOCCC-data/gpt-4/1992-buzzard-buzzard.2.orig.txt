This code seems to be an esoteric programming language interpreter for a language closely resembling Brainfuck, it's written in ancient K&R C language which lacks prototypes that we're accustomed to in modern C. 

Here's a summary of what this code does at large:

- The main function sets up some initial values by using 'a()' function and then enters a loop that reads and interprets the program.
- It uses a combination of macro definitions, functions, switch-case structures and lot of bit-level and memory access operations.
- It uses the structures like the preprocessor directives, switch-case, for loop for controlling the flow of the program.
- The 'a()' function probably takes a character from the input and associates it with an integer value that can be interpreted later.
- The 'r()' function is where the actual program interpretation happens. The function uses a switch-case structure and goes through a series of cases equivalent to the operators used in Brainfuck or more likely some similar esoteric programming language.
- This code defines its own versions of integer arrays and characters to save and manipulate data. Behaviour of different aspects of the language, for instance, how a number is read, how a character is printed, how loops work, are all implemented in these macros and functions.
- There's a lot of low-level direct memory manipulation like storing the values in arrays, then using pointers to access and modify the stored values.
- The print and read functionalities have also been divided into different cases.

Overall, the code is pretty advanced and is using numerous lower level programming techniques.

P.S.: It is important to note that without a thorough understanding of the esoteric language this code is interpreted for, and the ability to test it on a variety of inputs, it is hard to ascertain exact behaviors.
