The provided code seems to be a part of a game written in C language which uses the Simple DirectMedia Layer(SDL), a cross-platform development library designed to provide low level access to audio, keyboard, mouse, joystick, and graphics hardware via OpenGL and Direct3D. 

Here are some of the core functionalities noted:

1. SDL_Surface object might be used for creating a 2D game as it allows direct pixel manipulations which are used to create rendering effects in the game. 
2. Array `C` consisting of 2329 integers (`333*7`) possibly contains some game data, perhaps related to on-screen objects or sprites. 
3. Functions are being used to move objects around a game field (`bd` function, `bh` function, `bl` function etc.).
4. Some kind of conditions for movements (`if (B&128&&bf&&s<0)||(B&64)` and `if (B&1){ *u +=u[4] }` and `if (++u[5]>20){ u[4]*=  -1 u[5]=0 }`) exist which might be game rules.
5. Several global variables are modified which possibly keep track of game state/data.
6. Function `Y()` possibly resets some game parameters.

However, the code is given out of context and seems deliberately obfuscated (possibly a part of a contest, as `IOCCC` comment suggests - International Obfuscated C Code Contest). Providing complete exact functionality is therefore difficult. Some of the code seems incomplete (`BH` function for example) and may cause errors. 

Additionally, some information might be lost due to odd formatting and more specific functionality (like what game it might be, specifically what each function does etc.) cannot be gleaned without additional information, and in the current state, this code can produce errors if tried to compile and run.This continuation of the previous code appears to still be part of a game implemented using SDL in C Language, likely a 2D game. 

The `bz()` function appears to be used to handle audio data in the game by calling `SDL_MixAudio<>` which is used to mix audio data. The function `bq` reads a part of audio data from some buffer `S` starting at position `P` with a length of `bt` and mixes it to the buffer `br`.

In the `main` function, the game initializes the SDL audio and video, loading an audio file and playing it, and entering a game loop. The game loop continuously receives and processes player inputs, updates the game state with these inputs (moving objects around possibly), and draws the new state to the SDL_Surface.

However, the use of SDL functions suggests this could be either a game or a multimedia application. The code seems deliberately obfuscated, probably for a code competition like IOCCC (International Obfuscated C Code Contest) as hinted to in the comments.

Please note that the specific functionalities are hard to deduce given the obfuscation level, the lack of semantic variable names, and the lack of comments describing what the code does.
