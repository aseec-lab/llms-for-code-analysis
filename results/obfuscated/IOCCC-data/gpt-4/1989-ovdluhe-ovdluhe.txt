This is a piece of C code. It seems to be pretty complex and involves some macros and bitwise operations. Here is a high-level summary of what it does:

1. The `typedef char ape;` line declares `ape` to be a synonym for `char`.

2. The `#D)` directive is defining a series of macros whose names are `D`, `EA`, `EP`, `A`, `AP`, `P`, `AE`, `PE`, `E`, `APE` with specific values / operations.

3. `ape a[PE+A],ap,*ae,p[P+A],e[AE];` -- This line is declaring a few variables. `a` is an array of `ape` (which is actually `char`), `ap` is a single `ape` (again, a `char`), `*ae` is a pointer to an `ape`, `p` is another array of `ape`, and `e` is yet another array.
  
4. `main()` is the entry-point of the program. It's performing some series of tasks involving getting a character input, doing some calculations with the macros that were defined earlier, possibly putting a character output, and some manipulation with the arrays and pointers that were declared earlier.

5. `PA()` function is checking if every character of the string `p` appears in array `a`. For each character that appears, increment by one the counter of this character in the array `e`. It returns a random character in the “vocabulary”, weighted by the frequency of their appearances in the text.
  
In general, it looks like this program is related to some sort of character-level manipulation and processing based on user input and / or the contents of the `a`, `p`, and `e` arrays. It's hard to tell exactly what the intended outcome of this program is without additional context.
The code is intentionally obfuscated (perhaps for a programming challenge or as a sort of puzzle), and its purpose is not immediately evident without a deep understanding of C code and binary logic. The syntax and structure don't adhere to common practises, making it harder to read.
