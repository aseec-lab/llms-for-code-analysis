This code is written in C language. It seems complicated due to the intense use of macros and bitwise manipulations, but it basically implements variations of a recursive function with different behavior depending on the inputs. However, the specific functionality isn't entirely clear without a context. Here's an overview of what different sections of the code do:

Includes the standard io header file and defines macros e, g, h, f, j, k and l - mainly used in bitwise calculations.

Defines two arrays, tab1 and tab2 - integers and long integers, respectively.

The main function is designed in a non-conventional way. It accepts two parameters: an integer m1 and a pointer to a char (string) s. 

The first 'if' condition checks if m1 equals 1. If it does, a character array b is initialized and the main function is called again. After that, it tries to print b.

The 'switch' statement modifies m1 and chooses an option for execution, which includes recursive calls to the main function, operation over arrays, containing nested bitwise operations and recursive calls to the main, with parameters transformed by bitwise manipulations.

Finally, the default case does some manipulation on the char pointer s and recurses with slightly changed parameters, unless m1 equals e.

It's important to note that the code contains a lot of magic numbers and it may lead to unexpected results and behavior if not properly understood. Also, in its current state, this code is incomplete, as it doesn't include all the necessary closing brackets and semicolons.
