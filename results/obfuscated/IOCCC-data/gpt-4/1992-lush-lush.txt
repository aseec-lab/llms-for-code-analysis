This code appears to be written in C language and is quite abstract and messy, which makes it hard to understand. This is how much I can break down:

1. Several character pointers (s, t, v) and character arrays (_, x) are declared. A pointer 'p' points to the start of array 'x'. An array of characters 'av' is initialized with string W, H, o, l, N, e, r, and so on. Two integers are initialized to zero: n and __.

2. A main function is defined. The program uses the gets() function to get a string from stdin, saving the input string in the _ array. Then it appears to iterate through each character of the string (gets(_)) using a nested for loop.

3. Within the nested for loop, it checks if the current character is a number (0-9) && (and) next character isn't ':' or '. If it's true, it increments the pointer to the next character. If not, it performs some operations on integer variable n and __.

4. It seems like n multiplied by 2 and bitwise AND operation performed with character t. Next, bitwise AND performed on __ with 3.

5. If __ becomes zero, it checks if n is less than 15 and assigns the n-th element of av array to the p array, incrementing pointer p. Resets n to 0.

6. Finally, it seems to be putting a null terminator at the end of the string pointed to by p, then it calls the puts function to print the string and last the it assigns t to s.

Overall, it looks like some form of text processing is being performed to translate or encode/decode the input based on certain conditions and operations. However, it's quite confusing and obtuse due to its nonstandard style and lack of context.
