This line of C code declares a pointer to a char variable named `_` and initializes it to point at a null-terminated string "Hello world.\n". The '\' character is an escape character, and '\n' represents a newline character. This string is a constant char array stored somewhere in memory, and '_' will hold the address of the first character of this string. The string is used usually for debugging purpose or to be printed out later in the program.
