This is a highly obfuscated code written in C language. It doesn't have clearly defined beginning parts which makes it very hard to analyze in its current form. However, its basic structure contains:

- Definition of an integer variable `i`
- The `main` function that contains a `for` loop 
- An obscurely written `read` function possibly intended for file I/O operations. 

Without full context in a proper syntax, this code doesn't provide a clear, predictable functionality, and most likely would not compile due to syntax errors. 

Unfortunately, as it is written now, it's very challenging to tell you precisely what this code does. Please ensure you provided the code correctly or provide more details about its intended functionality.
