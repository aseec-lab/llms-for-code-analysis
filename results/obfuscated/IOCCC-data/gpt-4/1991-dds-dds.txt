This code appears to be written in C language, but it is obfuscated to make it hard to understand, and it undoubtedly makes use of unusual formatting and coding practices to disguise its actual function. Although the exact functionality is obfuscated, generally the code makes use of the following common operations:

1. File handling: It opens a file with the name passed as a command line argument with the use of 'fopen' and performs read/write operations on it. 

2. Procedures: It contains a main function where the operation is performed.

3. Loops and Condition checks: The code makes extensive use of conditional 'if' and infinite 'while' loops. 'Switch..case' statement is used for multiple condition checks.

4. Functions: The 'system' function is used to issue a command to the operating system.

5. Array and Pointer operations: The code plays around a lot with strings, characters, arrays, and pointers. 

Several sections of the code are purposefully scrambled, encrypted, or concealed, which implies it may be trying to perform a hidden operation or function that isn't entirely clear from the code itself. Particularly, the string defined by 's' and the character array 'R' are key components. To determine its full functionality, the code needs to be reformatted and deciphered carefully.
