This C program prints out the character that corresponds to the ASCII value 40. The ASCII value 40 represents the opening parenthesis '(' in the ASCII table. 

However, the code would not run because of syntax errors: missing semi-colons and an extra parenthesis. A corrected version would look like this:

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    int i=40;
    printf("%c", (char)(i));
    return 0;
}
```

The program starts declaring the main function, where the program execution begins. Inside this function, it declares an integer 'i' and assigns the value 40 to it. It then prints out this integer as a character using the printf function and the "%c" format specifier. The "(char)" before the 'i' is used to cast the integer 'i' to a char data type. Finally, it returns 0 to signal that the program has run successfully.
