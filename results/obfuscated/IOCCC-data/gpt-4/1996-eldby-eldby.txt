The code is attempted to be translated into readable format but seems cryptic due to missing syntax (such as missing semicolons and missing braces in the for loop statements). However, judging from the looks of code, it seems to be a compact (or obfuscated) C program which performs some kind of complex mathematical calculations and depends on a custom random number generator.

The custom random generator function `g()` generates numbers by following a sequence defined by a linear congruential generator algorithm formula `(f * 6478 + 1) % 65346`.

The function "m" appears to be setting some values into the arrays x, y, and r, using the random generator and some other variables.

The main function seems to be doing the following:

1. Initializing a couple of variables and arrays
2. Looping over an array and performing some calculations and assignments
3. A nested loop that seems to perform more calculations involving these arrays, and updating p[c] with some kind of calculation involving the k[] array.
4. A loop that updates z[i] depending on some conditions, including more calls to `m()`.
5. Finally, it prints out characters (presumably some kind of derived ASCII) to the console by iterating over the `t[]` array.

In summary, this is a compact mathematical and graphical operation of some sort, and outputs a textual representation of those calculations. Improved and more specific interpretation could be provided with a properly completed and formatted code, and some context about its purpose.
