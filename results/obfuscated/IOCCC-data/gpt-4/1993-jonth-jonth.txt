This code appears to be written in a very obfuscated manner, sometimes referred to as "obfuscated C code". It's a style of programming where code is written in a way that makes it extremely difficult to understand. 

By looking at the provided code, we can deduce that it's a sort of game:
- There are variables with names like "score" and "level", which are common in games.
- There's usage of the Xlib library, a basic library in C for creating GUI applications that use the X Window System.
- There are frequent references to positioning and screen-related attributes (e.g., XFillRectangle for making rectangles in UI, "XCreateGC" for creating graphics context).

Though, due to the obfuscated manner the code is written in, it's extremely difficult to accurately tell what specific game or type of game is being implemented. 

In addition, due to the split chunks and obfuscation, it's challenging to trace the execution flow, discern what specific functions do, or perceive the purpose of certain variables. 

As this technique is commonly used in contests, like the International Obfuscated C Code Contest (IOCCC), or as a form of amusement, reverse-engineering, or security through obscurity, it may not serve practical purposes or real-world applications. 

However, if required, a detailed code analysis could be done, but it would require significant time and effort due to the complexity and obfuscation in the code.
