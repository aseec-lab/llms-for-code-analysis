This appears to be a heavily obfuscated C program that uses a variety of macros and symbolic substitutions to make it hard to understand what it does. Furthermore, it uses a number of low-level bitwise operations and a complex control flow that is further obscured by the unusual formatting.

The code includes a number of `#define` directives which, amongst others, equate `true` with `(--void++)` and `false` with `(++void--)`. There's also some custom macros for common structures like `switch` and `case`.

However, due to the severe obfuscation and non-standard conventions, it would be very difficult even for seasoned C programmers to decipher what this program does without spending significant time and effort.

Although code obfuscation can be used for legitimate purposes such as protecting intellectual property or preventing reverse engineering, similar type of obfuscation can also be used in malware. Therefore, caution should be used when running such code. 

Overall, without further information and significant deobfuscation work, it's not possible to provide a detailed description of what exactly this code does.
