The code provided is a standalone C program and seems like a randomized text generator using some sort of Markov Chain-like process. There are some syntax errors as some semicolons and commas are missing throughout the code. However, the general purpose is quite identifiable.

Here's what it does in steps:

1. The program first checks if it has exactly 5 arguments (c != 5). If not, it immediately exits. It expects 4 arguments when it's run, which are the filename, output size, context size, and a seed for random number generation.

2. It opens the file specified by the first argument (v[1]) in read mode.

3. It then converts the second and third arguments to integers (atoi function), and uses the fourth for seeding the random number generator (srandom).

4. Using fseek and ftell, it measures the length of the file and allocates sufficient memory to hold twice this length plus the context size.

5. It reads the entirety of the file into memory, and begins filtering out unwanted characters (using the for loop and conditions on a). The valid chars are: ' ', '\n', '\r', '\t', and alphabets in uppercase and lowercase. If a line comment '<' is found, it skips to the end '>'. It tracks length (l) after filtering out undesired characters.

6. It then duplicates the content of the file in memory, wrapping around to meet the context 'ctxt'â€”this is for generating output later.

7. It then enters a loop to generate random texts. In each cycle, it picks a random location from the memory, then attempts to match a sequence of 'ctxt' characters as a substring starting from that position. After it finds the match, it prints the first character at that location and advances the position by one. 

8. This continues until the 'osize' of output characters has been printed, followed by a final newline.

The main logic of this code is a Markov Chain style text generator with a provided 'ctxt' value as the depth of the chain. However, without proper formatting and semicolons, the code will not compile and run.
