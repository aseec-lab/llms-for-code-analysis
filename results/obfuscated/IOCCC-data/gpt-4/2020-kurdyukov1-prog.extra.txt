The code quickly becomes complex due to its formatting and use of bitwise manipulation, where operations are performed directly on the bits which represent numbers. To understand what the program does, let's break down its main components.

This code defines a main function depending on the value of IDX, which may be any number from 1 to 4. Each value corresponds to a different code path or variant of the program.

1. If IDX == 1:

This program reads binary data from the standard input (stdin), performs some complicated mathematical and bitwise operations to it and then prints out the result as a 32-character hexadecimal string.

2. If IDX == 2:

This code does almost the same thing as the first variant. The primary difference is in the computations inside the for loops, suggesting different operations in manipulating input data.

3. If IDX == 3:

This variant of the program appears to have a more involved computation that somehow uses the 64-bit integers e, k, l, m, o and p in calculating the values adding to (or stored in) the array h[].

4. If IDX == 4:

This last variant seems to have more mathematical operations involving floating-point numbers.

In summary, the program reads binary data from stdin, uses bitwise operations and complex math to manipulate the values, then generates a 32-character hexadecimal representation and prints it out.
 
In all cases, the exact purpose of the code is hard to decipher without additional context, as it could be used for anything from encrypting/decrypting data, creating a hash function, or solving some kind of graphics or number crunching problem.
