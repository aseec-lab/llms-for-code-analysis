This code appears to be a form of a file compressor, specifically a version of PPM (Prediction by Partial Matching) compression algorithm, which is a type of statistical data compressor. This implementation is written in a quite obfuscated style, which makes it difficult to understand without careful analysis.

The code performs the following steps:

- It opens a file for reading. This file is supplied as a command line argument to the program. 
- It allocates memory for the entire file and reads the file's content into that memory.
- It then performs compression on the file content using PPM compression algorithm.
- During this, it also removes some non-printable ASCII characters (like newline, carriage return and tab) and extra white spaces.
- It writes the compressed data to the standard output.
- It cleans up the dynamically allocated memory before it terminates.
  
In terms of inputs and outputs:

- It takes 5 command line arguments: the name of the program itself, and four other arguments that determine the behavior of the compression.
- The program writes the compressed file to standard output and it may also write to standard error if an error occurs (for example, if it can't open the file for reading).
- It uses bitwise operations, point manipulation, and file handling, among other things to achieve this.
  
Remember that using programs like this on files without knowing exactly what they do can be risky, because it might lead to data loss or system vulnerability. Always make sure to back up your data before running a program on it, especially if the program is meant to modify the file in some way.

Lastly, because of heavy obfuscation, there could be some inaccuracies in this explanation. Understanding obfuscated code often requires a deep knowledge of both the programming language used and the programmer's intent, and even then it can be challenging.
