This is a highly obfuscated C program code, which appears to generate an ASCII representation of the Mandelbrot set. Here is a broad summary of what the code appears to do:

1. The `#define` directives at the beginning of the code are macros that serve to obfuscate the code, making it very hard to decipher. They like replace labels and syntax with alternative representations, for instance `_$()` can be replaced with `0`, `__$()` can be replaced with `1` and so on.

2. The first `$(n,i,t)  (*___)   ($(n,i,t))  = $(tch,  pu,  ar)` may define a function pointer that points to putchar function, which is used to print characters on the screen.

3. The `$(ub,do,le) _<::> $_$_ <%...%>` block appears to define several variables including the constant values used to determine the area of the complex plane to iterate over (`-2`, `1`, `-1.3`, `1.3`). 

4. The nested loops located in the lower half of the code likely represent the mathematical computations for generating each pixel of the Mandelbrot set.

5. In the macro `___($(m,i,au)[($(n,i,t)) _[_$_()____(_,_,_,_)]%__(_,_,_,_,_)])`, it calls the putchar function to display the ASCII Mandelbrot set.

6. There is recursion involved which might represent the recursive nature of the Mandelbrot computations.

7. The last `r(e,t)` seems to be a return statement for the main function.

8. The IOCCC 2014 comment indicates this was written for the International Obfuscated C Code Contest, a competition where participants aim to write the most obscure and complex functioning C code.

The given obfuscated code is written in a style that makes it very difficult to accurately decipher without seeing it execute and observing its runtime behavior.
