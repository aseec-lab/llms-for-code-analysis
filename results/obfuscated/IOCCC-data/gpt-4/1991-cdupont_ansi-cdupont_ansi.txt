This code is an example of obfuscated C code, which makes it difficult to understand what it does. It is not structured in a conventional way, which makes its purpose and functionality unclear.

This code includes various programming constructs like loops, conditionals, and bitwise operations. Also, it includes parts such as string input-output, file handling and various calculation processes. However, the way that these elements are assembled is very peculiar and unconventional (e.g. excessive use of goto statements, unorthodox variable names), making the purpose of the code near impossible to discern without additional contextual information, testing and debugging.

From the structure of the code, it appears to have several chunks. Each chunk possibly performing a different task. But, from a glance, it will require a lot of reformatting and restructuring to fully comprehend the code. 

Remember that writing such kind of obfuscated code is not recommended in the actual software development process as it is not maintainable or understandable by others. Clear, readable, and well-documented code is the standard practice.
