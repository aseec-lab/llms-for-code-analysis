This code appears to be a console or terminal-based game that uses `curses` library. The `curses` library is often used for creating text-based user interfaces in a terminal-independent manner.

The code seems to be written in an obfuscated form. Several operations have been defined as macros such as `Q` for `return`, `I` for 'for', `SRD` for `srand48`, `RD` for `lrand48` and so on.

The game initializes the console window, displays the usage instructions indicating that it uses l-h-k-j keys for movement, and "+" and "-" for incrementing and decrementing. The game can be exited by pressing 'Q'. It also sets up a grid in memory.

It appears that the grid is a 6x6 array `z[6][6]`, initialized with 5's (memset(z,5,36)). The array is then manipulated by the user's actions using "l-h-k-j" and "+/-" keys, and modifications are displayed to the terminal using `mvwaddch` (moving add character) function.

The function `d(a, b, c)` seems like a function that changes the grid's specific element by 1 or 9 depending on the position.

The starting function `main()`, handles the game logic like processing user input, updating the grid, handling window refresh, and exiting the game if conditions are met.

The random numbers are generated using `lrand48()` and seeded with `srand48()`.

Please note that the detailed functionality and rules of the game are very hard to decipher given the obfuscated form of this code. The specific goals and mechanics of the game are not clearly discernible without more context or in-line comments in the code. Further, safety checks (like array bounds checks) are not discernable in this obfuscated code leading to potential risk of buffer overflow. Please consider deobfuscating and carefully reviewing this code before using it.
