This code is clearly quite obfuscated, and uses a mix of macros, long jumps (setjmp() and longjmp()), bitwise operations, file I/O, time manipulation functions, and binary shift and logical operations. It has defined several macros to replace the instructions which would simplify the code. Moreover, tri-graphs ??() are used, which change into simple brackets in the code.

The main executable code in the default function 'main' does the following:

1. It captures the current date and time, running different actions depending on the presence of console arguments.

2. If any console arguments are present, it attempts to open a file corresponding to the provided path or filename. The file is assumed to hold data manipulated in some specific way that looks like an encrypted message.

3. Function 'strtok' is used to tokenize a string, where the string is assumed to be space, comma, or newline-separated.

4. Several sets of data are read and parsed from the file, and are sanitized and formatted before being converted into numeric values and stored in arrays.

5. Next, the 'setjmp' functions are used to set markers or jumps in the code where the program's state is preserved, allowing the program to jump back to these points at any point in the future.

6. The program then enters a specific logic branch where it uses bitwise shifts and logical AND operations to manipulate the data and prints the results. 

In conclusion, this code seems to be a part of a decryption or encoding scheme which takes data from a file and processes it in some specific way, it might be part of a larger program. The use of the specific preprocessing directives obfuscates the true purpose of the code. Still, it appears to involve obfuscation or encryption, possibly related to passwords handling or some cryptographic task.

Note: As the code is obfuscated, it is very difficult to provide a precise high-level summary of what it does. It would improve the understandability a lot if the tri-graphs were replaced with brackets and macros were replaced with the commands they represent.
