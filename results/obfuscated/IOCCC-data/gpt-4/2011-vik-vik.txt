The C code you posted seems to be an obfuscated sound synthesizer which performs audio processing and generation in real time. This program possibly creates procedural music or sound effects. It may potentially use an algorithmic approach to generate a continuous stream of music or sound effects.

Here are few specific observations based on the given code:

- The program reads in a binary file by using `fread` function and performs specific processing based on the file's symbol identifiers (like FT, CN and MK).

- It uses multiple string and mathematical operations for creating sound waves based on the data of the file.

- The `putchar` function is used to output the sound data. 

- It defines several macros for simplifying repetitive or complex operations.

But the program doesn't follow conventional coding styling and variable naming, which makes it hard to understand exactly what it's doing without extensive analysis. This is a typical characteristic of obfuscated code. Obfuscation is used for purposes like reducing the size of the code or hiding the actual logic implemented by the code.
