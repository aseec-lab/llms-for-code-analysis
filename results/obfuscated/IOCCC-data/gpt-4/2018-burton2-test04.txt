This is a simple C program that includes a standard library `stdio.h` and a function `main()`. `main()` is the entry point for any C program. In this case, it prints "hello, world!" to the console. 

If a preprocessor macro named FOO exists (`#ifndef FOO` checks this condition), the code won't be compiled, otherwise it will compile and execute normally and print "hello, world!".

One point of note is that there appears to be a syntax error in the code. The printf statement is not properly terminated with a semicolon (`;`). The correct line should be `return printf("hello, world!\n");`.
