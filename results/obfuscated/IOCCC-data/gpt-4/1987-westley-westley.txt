The code appears to be a stylistically obfuscated C-program that prints out the reverse of the phrase "Able was I ere I saw elbA". 

This particular piece of code is a type of obfuscated code, where the developer deliberately makes the code more complicated than necessary, sometimes as a challenge or a joke.

Here's a simplified interpretation of the code:

- The program starts with a variable declaration of a character array 'redivider' initialized with the phrase "Able was I ere I saw elbA".

- Variables 'deliver', 'reviled', and 'tni' are initialized and manipulated with obfuscating calculations, like '1+1' and '0xDECAL' which translates to hexadecimal for 57002. These might be just to confuse the reader without any real purpose.

- Through the obfuscated 'for' loops, it is iterating over the 'redivider' character array in reverse order. 

- It uses putchar, a standard library function to put/print the character corresponding to the ASCII value, on console.

Hence, the program, while appearing complex and obfuscated, is simply printing the reverse of a string.

It's possible however, due to the nature of obfuscated code, that there could be some mistakes in my interpretation. The code needs a cleaner representation for better understanding and analysis.
