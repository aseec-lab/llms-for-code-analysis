This code is complex and difficult to understand without knowing the definitions of each macro and the content of the included files. 

However, it is clear that these chunks of code are modifying and using preprocessor directives to create new definitions, include files, and perform conditional compilation. This is done through the use of `#define` (C), `#include` (l), `#ifdef` (O), `#undef` (Q), `#else` (G), and `#ifndef` (D).

As for the specific functionality and the output of this code, it's impossible to determine exactly without more context. These chunks of code heavily rely on macro definitions and file includes, which are not provided. The variables, file names and macro names themselves (like `FNAME`, `i`, `o`, `c`, etc.) are not self explanatory and we do not know what they represent or contain.

Furthermore, the formatting and obfuscation techniques used (like splitting keywords, using backslashes for line continuation, using single letter macro names etc.) make it particularly challenging to follow the logic of the code.

It would be easier to understand the code's specific functionality if we knew what the macros were defined as, what the variables contained, and what the included files' contents were.
