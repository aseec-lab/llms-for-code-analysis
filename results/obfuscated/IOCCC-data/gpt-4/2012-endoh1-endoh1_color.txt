This is a C program that performs a fluid simulation with obstacle handling. It's written in a style that conforms to the obfuscation requirements of the International Obfuscated C Code Contest (IOCCC). 

Here are the main points:

- The `#include` directives at the start invite three libraries: `stdio.h` for standard I/O operations, `unistd.h` for system calls, and `complex.h` for complex number operations.

- The `#define` directives introduce shortcuts for operations used later in the code i.e. they create macros. The last one (f(p,e)) loops over certain points of the array.

- The `double complex a[97687]` statement allocates an array of complex numbers.

- The `char b[97687]` statement allocates an array of characters. Some obfuscation is applied to display 'GO' at the start of the array, and what appears to be an escape sequence for clearing the terminal screen.

- The `void h(int e)` function appears to build frames for the simulation. 

- The `void g(int i)` function manipulates certain parts of the `b` array, likely in relation to output generation.

- The `main` function shows a fluid-dynamics loop which reads from `stdin` to set obstacles in fluid stream, computes and updates the fluid flow in its 'simulation space' (the array `a`), and builds and prints a frame of output for each iteration.

The program is working with complex numbers to simulate different flows of fluid, including their interactions with obstacles. The input and output are handled in a very obfuscated way, matching the criteria of IOCCC. 

Note: Running and understanding obfuscated code like this can be risky and challenging as it tends to be hard to read, understand and predict its actions. It's typically done for sport (like in the IOCCC), cryptographic purposes or to make reverse engineering more difficult.
