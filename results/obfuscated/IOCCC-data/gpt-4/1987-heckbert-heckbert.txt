The given code appears to be written in the C programming language but has been obfuscated. It reads input, processes it, and performs some action based on the provided inputs. Let's break it down:

1. `r, c[300001]` and `d= ">=<=!===||&&->++-->><<"`: These are defined as global variables. The array `c` appears to be used as a buffer for reading the input. The string `d` appears to be a set of two-character terminal symbols in some language: greater than or equal to, less than or equal to, negation, logical and, logical or, etc.
   
2. `main(a,b) char**b`: It is the main function, where the computation starts. `a` and `b` are the command-line parameters passed to the program. `p=a>1?atoi(b[1]):79` sets `p` to the second command-line parameter or `79` if the parameter is not provided. `r=c+read(0,j=l=i=c,300000)` reads input into the buffer `c`.

3. `g(j,m) char*j,**m`: This is a utility function. It seems to return different values ('0', '3', '4' or '2') based on certain conditions regarding the characters read in the `j` buffer.

4. `for(k=m v!=2 j=k,m=n,v=w,k=m){w=g(k,&n)`: This is the main loop where the code repeatedly calls the `g` function with different parts of the input, reacts based on the return value, and potentially output some characters.

Due to the obfuscated nature of the code and numerous short-named variables with no comments, it is not clearly decipherable what this C code is doing. It likely has some syntactically meaningful purpose, perhaps for scanning, parsing, or lexing a particular type of input. This kind of code is often found in compilers or interpreters for programming languages. Without more context or explanation it's hard to be certain of the exact functionality.
