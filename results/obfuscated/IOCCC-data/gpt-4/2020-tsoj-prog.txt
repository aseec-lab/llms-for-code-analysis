This is a console-based game written in C. The program characterizes user input, as from a keyboard, and handles console output. The exact nature of this game is not immediately clear from the chunk of code provided.

Based on the code, this game functions as follows:

1. Uses the terminal size to define the game area (based on window size).
2. Reads inputs from the user.
3. Updates the game state and draws game objects accordingly.
4. Detects collision between objects (based on their coordinates).

The game includes the following controls:

- The user can move an object (presumably the player's character) either up or down or to the direction of left or right by pressing the 'w', 's', 'a', or 'd' keys respectively.
- The game terminates if the 'q' key is pressed.

Here is the description about macros and functions in the code:

- `t()`: Returns current time in milliseconds.
- `g(x,y,u,v,s)`: Used to copy a portion of the game object string to the screen buffer.
- `l(x,y,w,h,a,b,c,d)`: Checks if a rectangular area overlaps with another area. Used for collision detection.

Finally, the game seems to be waiting for a certain time period between each update of the game state, allowing other processes to use the processor.

Please note that the code formatting is unusual and somewhat obfuscated, making it harder to understand than typical C code. The heavy usage of macros and 'goto' statements further contributes towards a cryptic appearance. Other critical game details and certain parts of the code structure (like closing brackets for structures and functions) seem to be missing or could be mixed in obscurely in the code. Also note that macros are generally discouraged in modern C programming due to their potential for causing subtle bugs and other problems.
