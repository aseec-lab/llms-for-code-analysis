This code is a type of obfuscated C code. It introduces undefined behavior and doesn't follow the general coding practices. Here's a basic analysis of what it does:

1. The main function accepts an integer `O`.
2. `I` is set equal to `O*4`. If `I` is not zero, the code inside the first `if` statement runs. 
3. The variable `l` is set to 6. 
4. If `l` is more than 5, it gets adjusted based on the value of `Q` and the ASCII value of a character read from the input minus 2. `Q` takes the value of the read character. 
5. If `Q` is not zero, it doubles its value and a string "has dirtiest IF" is indexed based on arithmetic involving `I`, `Q`, and `l`. The value from this index is then cast as an integer and added to `O`.
6. Eventually, the updated value of `O` is taken modulo 4, added to 8, and this final integer is printed out. 

It's important to note that without meaningful variable names and commenting, it's a bit difficult to understand its full purpose. Also, note the absence of type declaration for `O` in the main function, which is atypical. It seems to rely heavily on side effects of certain operations, and its functionality can be influenced by the user's input via the `getchar()` function.
