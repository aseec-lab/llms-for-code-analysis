The provided code seems to draw a 2D representation of a polynomial equation in some terminal-like environment. Here is a detailed analysis:

1) The `main` function takes command-line arguments (coefficients of a polynomial equation) as input.

2) The polynomial equation will be in the form `atof(argv[1]) * x^3 + atof(argv[2]) * x^2 + atof(argv[3]) * x + atof(argv[4])`. 

3) Through the nested loops, this polynomial function is evaluated at various x values (`x` from -20 to 10 in steps of 0.05). 

4) The results, represented in `y`, are then scaled and converted into screen coordinates (`r`,`c`), which are then stored in a grid represented by the 2D array `f`.

5) There are also loops that draw the bounds of the graph on the screen.

6) The final loops go through the accumulated data and convert the binary values into relevant characters from a string array. This character map seems to be intended for some sort of manual grayscale representation.

7) Then, the characters representing each pixel are written onto the console using `putchar`.

It should be noted that the code is messy. It uses deprecated practices like K&R style function declarations and implicit integer type with no clear type specification. It's also hard to read due to the unconventional layout.
