This code appears to be quite jumbled and contains several syntactical errors. It's extremely hard to understand due to its lack of indentation, inconsistent use of whitespace, and seemingly scrambled lines. Moreover, it's unclear where some functions or blocks of code begin or end, making it seem incomplete or incorrectly pasted. Here's a brief understanding based on the readable code:

1. The code begins by including the standard libraries stdio.h and string.h and defines some constants and variables.

2. The struct type object 'o' is declared which consists of a string 'X', an integer 'e', character 'f' and an array of structures 'w'.

3. The functions 'E', 'N' and 'A' which accept integer and character pointers as arguments, and 'main' function are there but they are very poorly formatted and tricky to understand.

In its current form, this code won't compile. Even if we fix the syntactical errors, there may be logical errors due to the incorrect arrangement of statements. It'll require significant clean up before it's clear what it's intent is.
