This piece of code is a rather obfuscated program written in C. It includes standard libraries unistd.h and time.h for some necessary functions. There are defined constant strings, arrays and hash-defined operations. There are also two functions: one defined function named `e` and the main function. 

The `e()` function iterates over values in an array (`o`) and then writes the contents of array `p` and a string `d` to standard output. The amount of data written depends on the differences of values in array `o` and the second parameter `h`. 

In the main function this program gets the current system time setting it to variable `a`. Then there is a complex triple for-loop structure. During this loop iterations data from character array `d` is transformed and set into an array `p` (which isn't completely shown here). 

Then several calls to the function `e` are performed. These function calls write certain parts of the string `d` to standard output. The parts are defined by the values in the array `o`. The selection and ordering of the parts apparently depends on the current system time. 

In general this looks like the program generates some kind of encoded message or data. The exact purpose or output can't be told without the complete definition of array `p` and a deeper analysis of hash-defined operations.
