The code is a mix of bitwise arithmetic, mathematical functions, file I/O, memory allocation, and iterations. Written in a cryptic and unconventional way with obfuscated variable names, making it challenging to comprehend.

Here is the high-level breakdown:

1. Several math libraries and other standard libraries are included at the start of the program.

2. It defines a macro "_" for float type to make the code more cryptic.

3. It has multiple functions which do things like allocating memory, reading characters from file, performing floating point calculations, opening directories, and reading files.

4. The CRUSH function seems to perform a weighted sum of an array.

5. The BITE function reads from standard input into a buffer, seems to count occurrences of specific pairs of consecutive bytes, and normalize the counts by the total count.

6. The CHEW function performs some calculations on the array and returns the last element of the array.

7. The GNAW function calculates some transformations of an array based on the FLESH parameter and the results of the CHEW function.

8. The EAT function opens a directory, reads files from it, and stores their contents as arrays.

9. The main function firstly initializes an array with random values, then it reads a file and checks for an argument. If a certain argument is provided, it performs a series of operations on the array using the GNAW function and writing the results back to a file, otherwise, it opens files and performs the CHEW function on the contents.

Though, because of the obfuscated nature of the code, this is a rough estimation of what this program does. It's also important to note that true purpose of this code is not clear without the understanding of the context in which it is being used. The code might be used for tasks like data analysis, pattern recognition, or some other complex computations.
