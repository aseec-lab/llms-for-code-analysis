This is a C program that is used to print the command-line arguments that have been passed to it. The main function is taking two arguments: int ac (the count of command-line arguments), and **av (a pointer to an array of pointers to string, which are the actual command-line arguments).

If there is more than one command-line argument, it enters the while loop -- using --ac to decrement the argument count until it hits zero, and *++av to increment the pointer to the next string in the array each iteration -- and uses the puts() function to print each argument (also known as console writing).

If there is only one command-line argument (usually that is the name of the program itself), it prints 'none' to the console. 

Keep in mind that the program does not follow the recommended coding standards for C language, especially the lack of proper bracing. This code is a compact, almost obfuscated version.
