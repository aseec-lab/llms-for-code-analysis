The provided code is a sorting algorithm, specifically an implementation of the Fisher-Yates shuffle algorithm, also known as Knuth shuffle. It sorts a list of items in a random order, each with nearly equal probability.

Here's a more human-friendly translation of the code:

1. Get a string of characters from the standard input (the user, usually through the keyboard). This string must consist of lower-case English alphabetic characters, and it is stored in the array `t`.

2. Shuffle this string and output the result. Shuffling is done through the Fisher-Yates algorithm. 

   In the Fisher-Yates shuffle, we start from the end of the array and swap each element with an element in a random position below it. 
   
3. If there are more characters, go to step 1.

4. End execution.

Here are some details to note about the code:

i. This is a C program. It uses the standard C libraries `stdio.h`(standard input/output header), `stdlib.h` (standard library header), and `time.h` (time header).

ii. The program uses `srand(time(0))` to guarantee that `rand()` will generate a different series of numbers each time you run the program, because `time(0)` returns the number of seconds since 1970.

iii. Input is taken through getchar() which reads the next available character from the screen.

iv. The putchar() function writes a character (an unsigned char) specified by the argument char to stdout.

v. The size limit for the input string is 64. Hence if the user enters a string of length which exceeds 64, the program only takes first 64 characters and terminates. 

Overall, this is a relatively complex piece of code due to the lack of variable names or comments, but it is simply shuffling characters from input strings.
