This C program calculates the Julian Day from any given day, month, and year. 

The function "double dmy2jd(double d, int m, int y)" takes as input the day (as a double), the month, and the year (as integers). It then computes the Julian Day number using an algorithm taken from Astronomical Algorithms by Jean Meeus. 

The Julian Day number is useful for astronomical calculations as it gives a single number that corresponds to a date/time value, rather than having to deal with separate values for day, month, and year.

This program also takes command line arguments for the day, month, and year in order to calculate the Julian Day. If the number of command-line arguments is not 3, the program will output a usage message and return a non-zero exit status.

Finally, it calls the function using the command line arguments (converted to a float and integers respectively), prints out the resulting Julian Day number, and returns a zero exit status, signaling a successful run of the program. 

The program checks whether the date is before or after the Gregorian Reform (October 4, 1582), and adjusts the calculations accordingly.
