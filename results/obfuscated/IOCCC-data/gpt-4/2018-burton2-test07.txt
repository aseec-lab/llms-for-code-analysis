This is a C program that outputs lines of text and integer numbers based on the arguments passed on the command line.

1. It initializes a character array `foo[]` with the value "line one\ntwo\nthree\n". The backslashes at the end of each line of the string imply that the string is going over multiple lines (they are 'continuation lines').

2. Then it checks if the first character of the first argument (`av[0][0]`) is a double quote. 

    - If it is, it checks the second character of the first argument (`av[0][1]`). If the second character is 'a', it prints out 'a', and if it's 'b', it prints out 'b'. If it's any other character, it does nothing.

3. It then enters a `while` loop, which will continue as long as the argument count (`ac`) is more than 0, each time decrementing `ac` by one. In the loop, it prints out the current value of `ac`.

4. After exiting the loop, it prints out the value of `foo` (which is "line one\ntwo\nthree\n").

Note: As written, the code won't actually compile due to syntax errors. There are missing semicolons, two of them should be at the end of `printf("a\n")` and `printf("b\n")`. Another one should be placed after `printf(foo)` and `printf("%d", ac)`. The string should also be ended correctly. In C, you need to put ';' at the end of each statement. Furthermore, the declaration of the `main` function isn't following the standard format. It should be written as `int main(int ac, char **av)`.
