The code is obfuscated C code. It appears to take input from stdin, perform some operations, and output the results. Here are parts of the code explained:

- Variables are declared at the beginning; arrays, pointers and individual characters with no immediate assigned value.
- It defines several functions (X, E, l, B, j, b, t, R, O, C) which are later called in the main function. Precise function of these isn't entirely clear without a close line-by-line examination.
- The 'main()' function finally performs the operations via sequencing of the defined functions. It appears to be a driving function equivalent to a parser for some custom definition language.
- A portion of the program appears to be responsible for processing input received from the user via the 'gets' function.

Keep in mind that aside from its obfuscation, the program uses outdated and insecure functions (like 'gets'), which should not be used in modern, secure C programming. This code is very hard to understand due to odd formatting and use of single character variable/function names.

Moreover, it uses array-indexing as pointers, post-(pre-)increment operators (++ --), pointer dereference and bitwise shifts (& >>), mixing them in complex expressions which makes it more difficult to understand.

Identifying the purpose of this code just by analyzing it could require a significant effort due to its complexity and non-standard writing. One would need to possibly execute, debug and check with various inputs to fully understand this.
