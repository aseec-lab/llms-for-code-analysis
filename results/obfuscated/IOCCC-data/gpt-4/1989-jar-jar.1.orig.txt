This line of code in C or C++ declares a pointer to a character array named 'He' and initializes it with the string "llo world.\n".  

The symbol '*' in front of 'He' indicates it is a pointer. The equal sign is used for assignment, and the characters within the double quotes "" are the string that 'He' is being assigned.

The special sequence '\n' is an escape character that represents a newline. 

So, the string "llo world.\n" assigned to 'He' would result in the output:
llo world
(then a new line) when printed.
