This code is an obfuscated C code. It won an award in the 20th IOCCC (International Obfuscated C Code Contest) in the category "Worst Abuse of the C Preprocessor". Here's what it does:

1. It reads the input into a buffer while performing some transformations.
2. It generates a set of bits from the processed input.
3. It produces text output based on the generated bits.
4. It does all this with a heavy use of ternary `(?:)` operator, pointer arithmetic, bitwise operations and nested loops.

Due to its obfuscation and complex logic, pointing the exact implementation details of what the code is doing is quite challenging without carefully deobfuscating the code. Usually, these types of codes are written to hide the original intent of the program, so deobfuscating them can be quite a challenge.This line of code simply means that the function returns a value of `0` and then ends. 

In C, the `return 0;` statement at the end of the `main` function indicates that the program has ended successfully. If the program were to return something other than `0`, that would indicate that some kind of error occurred. 

Please note that in modern C programming, the explicit `return 0;` line at the end of the `main` function isn't mandatory. The C standard guarantees that it will implicitly return a success value. However, it is a good style and practice to maintain as it can improve the readability and maintainability of your code.
