This code is quite unusual due to its heavy use of the digraph and trigraph features in C and C++ languages, now mostly obsolete features. Digraphs and trigraphs were introduced to help programmers who use a keyboard layout that does not support all the ASCII characters.

Here is the converted, understood version of the code:

```c
int _, O, __(char c)
main(){
    while(O ? gets((rand()%O++ ? ':' : _)+__) || puts(&__(_)) & _ : srand(time((O+++_))) || O)
}
```

However, even after conversion, the code can hardly be explained due to some syntax errors and missing logic. For example, function "__" is declared with no return type, "main()" doesn't have the correct prototype, and variables "_" and "__" are used without being initialized.

Importantly, this kind of code typically exists to confound programmers or as a form of obfuscation, being practically unreadable and hardly maintainable. Therefore, it is considered as a bad practice to produce such code.
