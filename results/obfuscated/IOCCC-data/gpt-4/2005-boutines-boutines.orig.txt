The code you've provided is written in the C programming language and appears to be obfuscated, causing difficulty in understanding it because of the unconventional coding style.

Here's what the code is doing from a high-level perspective:

1. It first contains a series of #define statements, defining different macro replacements for abbreviating code. These abbreviations can make the code harder to read.

2. It includes the `stdlib.h` and `stdio.h` libraries. These libraries are used for operations such as dynamic memory management and input/output functions.

3. Then, it defines several variables, arrays, and function prototypes using non-descriptive names such as '_', 'v', and 'std'.

4. The main function of the program takes a number of floating-point inputs, stores them into an array, and sorts them. 

5. Then, it seems to generate an SVG (Scalable Vector Graphics) image using these numbers. The numbers might represent some form of geometry or mapping that's to be represented graphically in SVG format. It writes the SVG elements to output in a very complex and confusing way.

6. At the end of the main function, the allocated memory is freed and the program returns with the output.

This code can be considered somewhat troublesome due to its obfuscated nature and lack of good programming practices such as clear variable naming and comments.
