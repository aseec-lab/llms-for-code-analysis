The given code is written in C and seems to be a rudimentary implementation of a maze-solving or maze-generation algorithm, using the recursion and randomness to explore potential paths. 

I will break down its functionality:

- `#define r return` is defining a macro "r" as a shorthand for "return".

- The char pointers (`u0` through `u5`) are holding strings for different output messages that are used throughout the program.

- The char pointers `o`, `x`, `y`, `z`, `w`, `v` seem to hold terminal control sequences which are used to control the cursor position in the terminal while printing the output or clearing the terminal screen.

- `b[1841]` is defining a character array which represents the maze or grid that the algorithm will traverse.

- `int c,d,e,f,g` are integer variables used to hold data throughout the maze generation/exploration, like current position, random numbers, etc.

- `typedef int(*h)()` is a typedef declaration for a function pointer, where h can be assigned the address of any function taking no arguments and returning an int.

- `h i,j,k,l,m,n` are function pointers i.e. pointers which can point to any function which takes no arguments and returns an int. These pointers are assigned the address of various standard library functions later in the code (printf, srand, rand, time, getchar, main).

- Now it initializes these function pointers with respective lib functions and constructs the maze randomly. 

- The code is written in a very particular style known as "Obfuscated C". It makes use of obscure C language features and idiosyncrasies to write code that is difficult to read, understand, and analyze.
  
Despite the obscurity, the key mechanic of interest is that it seems to use these function pointers and various conditionals to recursively explore the grid, marking its path with ".", until it either hits an obstacle ("a wall") or finds the end point.

Remember, to understand such code, you may need more detailed knowledge of C/C++ and need to understand the context or usage of such code.
