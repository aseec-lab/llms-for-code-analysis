The code appears to be a poorly-formatted and obfuscated hex dump program written in C. Here's a higher-level overview of what it does.

As this is an obfuscated code it uses obscure variable, constant, macro names and complex computation expressions to make the code hard to read and understand. Constant values are represented in a non-typical way using bitwise operations. This code opens a file and reads it character by character, then outputs the contents of the file in both hexadecimal and ASCII format. It uses several printf and putchar calls to format the output.

In the main function, it first checks that the proper number of command line arguments were passed in. If not, it prints a usage statement and then exits. If the correct number of arguments were passed, it attempts to open the first argument as a file. If the file cannot be opened, it prints an error message and exits. Otherwise, it enters a loop and begins to read in the file. For each character, it records the file position and prints it out, as well as the ASCII representation of the character.

The while loop is the heart of this program. It reads and processes each character from the file. First, it reads characters from the file until it has read 16 characters or reached end-of-file. Then it adds the file offset to the beginning of the line and formats the line for printing. If a character is printable (between ' ' and '~'), it prints it; otherwise, it prints a '.'.

This keeps happening until all the characters in the file have been read. The file is read and printed in segments of 16 characters each.

However, this is overall quite a tough to read code due to the obfuscation techniques used like macros for function names, complicated symbols for simple tasks, and overall poor formatting that makes it harder to understand. This code would be easier to read with good formatting, better variable names, and comments to explain what each part is doing.
