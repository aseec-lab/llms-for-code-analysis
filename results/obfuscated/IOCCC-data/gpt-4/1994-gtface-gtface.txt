This code appears to be a graphical buffer display system written in the C programming language. 

Here's what it's doing:

1. A 2D array `graphtab[16][16]` is declared that contains several ASCII characters. This seems to be a character mapping table.

2. `BITROWS`, `BITCOLS`, `SCREENROWS`, and `SCREENCOLS` are defined as constants. These values signify the dimensions of the framebuffer and the screen resolution respectively.

3. The framebuffer is defined as a 2D array of characters `framebuffer[BITROWS][BITCOLS]`. This serves as a buffer to hold bit pattern to be displayed.

4. Macros for setting and clearing bits in the framebuffer are defined `BITSET` and `BITCLR`.

5. A strange and incomplete function definition for `double f()` and `double atof()` is present, but these functions don't seem to do anything because they aren't defined further in this code.

6. A `FILE` pointer `d` is mentioned, likely for file reading but it is never utilized in this part of the code.

7. In the `main` function, it reads from standard input three hexadecimal numbers per line for 48 lines and stores these numbers into the framebuffer using the function `bs()` (bit set).

8. The `bs` function sets the respective bit in the framebuffer based on the value in the 16 bit number read earlier.

9. `bitshow()` is then called which calls `bitshow2()` (or `bitshow1()` if uncommented).

10. `bitshow1` and `bitshow2` functions convert series of 4 and 8 bits respectively from the framebuffer into a single character based on the mapping in graphtab. These characters are then displayed on the console, creating an ASCII representation of the data stored in the framebuffer.

In summary, this code appears to read binary data from standard input, represent it in memory as bits in a framebuffer, and then render those bits as ASCII characters on the terminal. This is an ancient way to do simple graphic operations in environments that support only text, pre-graphic interfaces.
