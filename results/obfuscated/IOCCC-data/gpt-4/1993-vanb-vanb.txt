The provided code is an obfuscated C program. While this style of programming makes it extremely difficult to understand, it seems to be performing operations on character pointers (C string or rather an array of character pointers), doing some arithmetic and logical operations based on their ASCII values, and recursively calling itself with different parameters until it reaches a termination criterion.

However, due to the complexity and obfuscation, it's challenging to determine its exact functionality without additional information. Given the heavy usage of bitwise operations (^ , & , >>), ternary conditions, ASCII characters comparison, recursive function calls and the use of the printf function, it could be potentially doing some encoded/encrypted printing, parsing, code generation or some sort of String manipulation.

It is worth mentioning that interpreting obfuscated code like this without context can be insecure as it may contain hidden or harmful functionality.
