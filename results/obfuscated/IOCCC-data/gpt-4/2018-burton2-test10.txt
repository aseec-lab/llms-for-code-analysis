This code is written in a variant of C programming language called the "Trigraphs". The director-question marks are trigraph sequences, a method of providing characters unavailable in the character set on the keyboard. 

This C program prints "Hello, world!" into the console if there are no command line arguments (excluding the program name itself). If there are command line arguments respectfully, it prints "Hello, {command line argument}!".

In standard C, the code would look like this: 

#include <stdio.h>

int main(int ac, char **av){
if (!(ac > 1)){
printf("hello, world!\n");
}
else{
printf("hello, %s!\n", av[1]);
}
}

Please note that if you give multiple command-line arguments, it will only use the first one to print hello, {command line argument}! The remaining arguments would be ignored.
