The coding language used here is a combination of the rarely-used Trigraphs and Digraphs in C and includes standard C syntax as well. These have been used to obscure the code somewhat rigorously.

This program is a Quine - a program that prints out its own source code when run. However, due to the use of trigraphs and digraphs in C, the code looks rather obfuscated.

The char array `a` is assigned multiple strings of code. The function `t` is created to convert these by translating trigraphs and digraphs back into their original characters before printing them out.

After the printing, the main function checks for any system errors. If none exist, the program terminates successfully. If there are any system errors, it closes and returns a failure status.

This program is self-replicating and exhibits a rarely-seen feature of C constructs.

Bear in mind that this code may not run correctly in modern compilers due to the use of outdated trigraphs. They have been officially removed from the language in the newest C17 standard.
