This code is quite challenging to read due to its extensive use of macros making it rather obfuscated. 
The macros are used in a way that is not immediately understandable; it looks like they are occupying namespace and forming data coldly. 

However, the code appears to be a part of a Turing machine implementation or part of code that would execute in a programming language with macro capabilities like Lisp or C. 

The Turing machine is a hypothetical machine thought of by the mathematician Alan Turing in 1936. It is a method used to explain the concept of an algorithm or computation, in relation to solving problems. The code has a "tape" state, which is consistent with the tape concept in Turing machine. 

The last part of the code, namely `int main () {puts ( R ( A, tape))}` aims to print something that is generated by a macro `R`. The symbol `R` and the other names used in the macros are abstract, and itâ€™s hard to say without more context what the developer was aiming for.

Finally, code like this is intentionally written in an obfuscated manner for competition or security purposes or just to confuse the reader. It's not representative of clean, maintainable, or self-explanatory code.
