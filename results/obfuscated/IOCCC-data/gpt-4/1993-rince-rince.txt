This code is a C program that models a 2D cellular automaton, where each cell can be in one of several states that are determined by the states of nearby cells. The automaton's rules are defined by a configuration file, which specifies the behavior of each cell type and how it interacts with its neighbors. The program initializes a grid based on the dimensions given in the configuration file, updates the grid cells based on the automaton rules, and then repeatedly refreshes the display to show the current state of the grid. The method of displaying the grid utilizes the ncurses library, which allows for character-based graphic design inside a terminal. 

The 'a' function is to simulate and display the grid based on the rules set in the file. It operates by running a loop that performs the following operations: 

- It updates the display by printing the current state of the grid. 
- It updates the grid by applying the automaton rules to each cell. 
- It refreshes the display and waits for a specific duration.

We can also note the presence of usage of standard input/output library, curses library, simulating 'jump' statements and file handling in the code. 

It's important to note that this code uses some relatively complex programming techniques, such as low-level string manipulation and the use of the jmp_buf data structure for setjmp/longjmp flow control. Because of this, understanding the code without tracing the execution might be difficult.
