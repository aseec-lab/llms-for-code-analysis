The given piece of code seems to be written in C language even though it doesn't follow standard C code formatting and syntax norms, which makes it harder to analyze. Furthermore, the code is incomplete ('for' loops are empty), contains several auto decrements and increments (++ and --) and pointer operations, which add multiple layers of complexity. 

However, it seems like the code is supposed to take arguments from the command line (char**l). It then modifies the last character to be a newline character (ASCII 13) and the second character of the next argument to be a null character. Finally, it is supposed to print out the first argument (a string) and then perform some complex operations with the characters of the string.

Due to these factors and errors in the code, it could result in unpredictable behavior when run-time errors occur because string null terminators are being overwritten, command line arguments are being modified, and out of bounds memory might be accessed.

Please provide the full and corrected code in order to be able to provide a more accurate description of what it does.
