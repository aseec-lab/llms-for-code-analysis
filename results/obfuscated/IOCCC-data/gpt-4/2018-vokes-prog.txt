The provided code seems to be a series of functions implemented in C programming language. Since it is not organized in a typical, readable manner, detailing every part of the code can be a bit tricky. However, based on an overall analysis, here's what the code seems to do. 

The code has multiple functions such as `meltdown`, `magic`, `cast`, `spell`, `witch`, `brew`, `newt`, `bubble`, `boil`, `hex`, `nasal_demons`, `toil`, `bat`, `potion`, `toad`. Each function performs distinct operations. However, without knowing how these functions are called, it is difficult to predict what the overall code does. 

The code uses some obscure practices like manipulating function pointers (`_ = hex` for example), which makes it harder to define what's happening without context. Most likely, this resides in a larger codebase, and without that context or comments in the code, a lot of the functionality is obscured.

A few specific details it's possible to glean:
- It looks like this code might be dealing with some form of graph or network, likely implementing some kind of graph traversal or processing algorithm. It seems to use a sort of adjacency list to represent it (`W **a`).
- Function `meltdown` seems to allocate and/or resize dynamic memory, and exit the program when memory allocation fails.
- Reallocating memory is used in several places and an exit is performed if that allocation fails.

In its current form, it's not very idiomatic or diagrammatic C code - it's extremely stylized, unconventional, and hence a bit hard to read. There are a lot of advanced or obscure techniques used, and without more context, it's not possible to accurately say what the overall purpose of this code is.The new code snippet appears to continue from the previous one. We can identify and describe some functions' purposes in the context-less environment.

- `familiar()`: It calls function `brew` (apparently a kind of memory allocator) to allocate memory of delivered size. If the memory fails to allocate (i.e., the returned pointer is null), it appears to end the program by calling an unspecified function `_`. After some arithmetic operations to determine size, it seems to use `memcpy` to copy memory from an array `Y` to the memory location identified by a pointer `i`. 
- `spectre()`: Reads data from `Z`, seemingly performs some kind of validation (the condition `(W)*Z-060>011`) and then calls `toad` as a part of the supposed validation operation. Further, it appears to process a global array `i`. It ends with a recursive call if a certain condition is met.
- `main()`: The main function initializes some global fields and starts the main loop, which reads lines from the `stdin`. The loop will call `spectre` on each line, check the size of a certain array `a` (re-allocating to make larger if necessary), and calling the function `_` with some mysterious parameters.

As an overall perception, the code appears hostile for readability and maintainability. It uses highly obfuscated function and variable names as well as unconventional whitespace. It also includes unorthodox C programming methodologies, including pointers to functions stored in variables and a multitude of global variables. The code has no comments and uses goto statements, which are generally considered a bad practice in modern C programming.

Please note, these interpretations are subject to the lack of context and might differ in the whole context of the original program.
