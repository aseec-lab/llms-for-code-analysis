This is a basic C program. 

- It declares a global character pointer (an array of characters or a string) `dquote` and initializes it to "dquote". 
- Then it defines a `main` function with parameters that handle command line arguments.

In the main function:

- It first checks if there are any arguments (i.e., if `ac > 1`) and if the first argument begins with a double quote (i.e., if `av[1][0] == '\"'`). `ac` represents the number of arguments provided when running the program and `av` is a pointer to the array of character pointers representing the strings passed to the program. If both conditions are met, it prints the word "dquote".
- It then checks if `ac` is zero. If it is, it prints "int ac is zero\n".

Please note that the program is incomplete and may not compile nor run correctly as no headers are included and the `printf()` function calls are missing the required pair of parentheses along with newline characters (`\n`) at the end of the string to format the output nicely.

The corrected code would look something like the following:

```c
#include <stdio.h>

char *dquote = "dquote";

int main(int ac, char **av) {
	if (ac > 1 && av[1][0] == '\"')
		printf("%s\n", dquote);
	if (ac == 0)
		printf("int ac is zero\n");
	return 0;
}
```
Please test this code in your own environment as it could have a different behavior depending on the specific compiler and operating system used.
