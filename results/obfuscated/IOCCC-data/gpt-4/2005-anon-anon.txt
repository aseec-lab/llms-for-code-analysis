The supplied code was not formatted correctly, thus making it extremely difficult to understand. However, after initial analysis, it appears to navigate a grid space with enumeration labels. 

Below is a general description of the key macros / functions found in the code:

- `system("stty cbreak -echo")` and `system("stty sane")` are shell commands through which the terminal's configuration is altered. `-cbreak -echo` puts the terminal in instant character mode and does not echo commands, whereas `stty sane` restores the terminal to its default settings.
- `X(i)`, `Y(i)`, and `Z(i)` seem to be used for obtaining x, y, and z coordinates of an element in a 3D array or grid.
- Main function is heavily obfuscated and making use of macros in an unusual way, i.e., by overloading common control structures such as `if`, `do`, `return`, etc. So it's difficult to understand the real functionality without proper formatting and clean coding.

Please note because the code is obfuscated, uses unconventional means of defining keywords such as `do`, `if`, `return` etc, heavily relies on macros for logic operations, readability and maintainability of such code is very poor. Also, safe practice like error checking, input validation & sanitization is not followed. This code also makes use of system calls which can make it less portable and more dependent on the host's environment configuration. 

I highly recommend rewriting this for transparency and best practices conforming code if you would want to use it or understand it better.
