Analyzing code of such complexity is quite challenging, but it appears to be implementing a kind of pathfinding algorithm using some encoding method. 

Here's an approximate description of its functionality:

1. The code includes standard input/output libraries and sleep function library.
2. It defines a large array of `int` named `_int[]`.
3. The main function is a bit complex and larger than usual. It's using a lot of GOTOs, which is considered a bad practice in modern programming, as it makes the code harder to read and maintain.
4. Inside main ,integers, pointers to integers and function pointers for malloc, fflush, printf and putchar are declared.
5. When the main function is executed, it creates an array that decodes to a character array, creating a 2D maze along with the start point '@' and an end point '!'.
6. Once the array (maze) is prepared, it implements a kind of breadth-first search (BFS) algorithm to find the shortest path from the start to end position. It uses a heuristic that suggests which node should be explored next.
7. It prints out the path taken in real-time, adding a delay of 25 milliseconds between each move. If it reaches a position where there are no moves left, it backtracks.
8. The path taken from start to end is then displayed with '/' replacing ' ' and '_' replacing '@'.
9. If no path can be found, or if any error occurs during the maze input, it jumps to "ten:" which does a cleanup routine and ends the program.
10. It also handles basic input and output operations and memory management.

Due to the manner this code was written (i.e., using GOTO statements, array of integers to represent characters, unclear variable names), it is quite hard to tell exactly what each part does. But the general structure does resemble a simple maze-solving algorithm.
