This code is a short but very complex obfuscated C code, written by Simon Whitechapel for the 1990 International Obfuscated C Code Contest (IOCCC).

The objective of the IOCCC is to write the most obscure or obfuscated C program in under 4096 bytes, whilst showcasing creative and unusual ways to utilize the C language.

At its core, the code takes in a single command line argument, treats it as a file name, and opens the file for reading. It then opens a series of other files for writing. The file names and the operations it performs on these files are dictated by the obfuscated data in the large string array.

The string contains encoded instructions. These instructions are read in a loop: one character at a time. During this loop, it executes one of five actions based on the encoded instruction it read: copying characters from the input file to memory, writing characters from memory to an output file, repeating a character multiple times, jumping to a different part of the encoded instructions, or incrementing a memory location.

When all instructions are executed, it uses the system function to execute a shell command. The command that gets executed is contained in the string but is obfuscated.

It should also be noted that to further obfuscate what the code is doing, the author has used #define to redefine the keywords "while", "break", and "case", which can make following the control flow of the program very confusing for someone trying to analyze this code. 

Without the original files that this program works with, determining exactly what this code does is quite challenging.
