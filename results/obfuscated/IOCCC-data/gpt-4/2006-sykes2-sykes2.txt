This code when executed prints out a 3D analog clock representation of the system time to the console. 

This code uses the C-language's __TIME__ preprocessing directive to take the local time of the system and output a rendition of an old-style analog clock using ASCII characters.

It's a clever piece of code known as "obfuscated code" where seemingly simple tasks are carried out in unusual ways, often using lesser-known features of the programming language. The code is usually designed to be confusing, amusing, or challenging to understand.
