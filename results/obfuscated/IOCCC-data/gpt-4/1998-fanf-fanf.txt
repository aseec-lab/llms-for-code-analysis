The code is written in a highly obfuscated way using macros to map names to complex expressions or function calls. But from the macro names, you can see that some of them represent certain forms in the lambda calculus, which is a formal system for expressing computations based on function abstraction and application.

The main program consists of calling various macro functions that presumably build up complex structures with a lambda calculus style of computation.

In general, the code seems to be a kind of interpreter or a reduction engine for the lambda calculus or some other formal system with similar properties.

For instance, the `lam`, `atom`, `ore`, `abs`, `make`, `opt` etc. appear to be building blocks that represent lambda abstractions, atom handling (probably for literals), boolean OR operation, absolute computation, making data pairs, optimizing expressions etc. which are common operations in a lambda calculus system or comparable formal systems.

The 'main' block of the code appears to be calling all these lambda calculus style of computation operations, likely creating a specific, complex computation in this calculus.

Additionally, there are macro functions that seem to handle input/output operations, like `putchar` and `getchar`, which indicates that this code has some sort of interactivity.

Also note `#if 0 ... #endif`, which is a control structure that disables blocks of code. It's often used in C and C++ programs for debugging or testing.

The specifics of what the code does exactly are not immediately apparent because the code mystery is obscured by heavily using preprocessor directives and is not straightforward to disentangle. It could take a very long time to understand the exact effects. Additionally, it's also not clear how the code runs as it might require specific preconditions on the environment it's executed in.
