The C code included is very intricately obfuscated and not conventionally formatted, making its functionality non-trivial to determine. It seems to include a mix of different functionalities, including use of file APIs. 

The code appears to process command-line arguments and uses a defined struct. It seems to read and interpret data from these files and perform operations depending on the content of the files. The struct contains pointers and integer data members, which could be used in various ways depending on the data read in from files.

The initial part includes preprocessing to define macros and some standard C library headers. Later part of the code seems to perform operations like reading file content and allocating memory. The code appears to also handle the opening and closing of file streams and the printing of certain data to the console, possibly error messages. 

Without specific contextual knowledge or significantly more time to comb through the code line-by-line, it is unfeasible to conclusively describe precisely what it does. It would also potentially require running the code with different inputs to test its functionality.
