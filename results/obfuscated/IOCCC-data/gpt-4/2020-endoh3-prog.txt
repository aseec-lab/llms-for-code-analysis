The provided code appears to be written in the C programming language. Unfortunately, it is obfuscated code, meaning that it is intentionally written to be confusing and difficult to read, possibly in order to obscure its function. However, let's attempt to understand its function.

1. It looks like this program could be a part of a clock program. The term `__TIME__` that is used in this code is a preprocessor macro that includes the current time the source file as a string literal in the format "hh:mm:ss". The sscanf function seems to be parsing this time string.

2. Based on some of the defined values and the numerous arithmetic operations noticeable, the obfuscated code creates a specific pattern or image. The manipulated values are being added to a string and then printed on the console from the "puts" function.

3. Note the presence of the text "IOCCC'20" which is the acronym for the International Obfuscated C Code Contest, further supporting that this code is intentionally obfuscated.

4. Also, we have a series of definitions (macros) early in the code '#define/**/Q(x,y)char/q=y#x","#y")",*p,s[x]', which again use uncommon syntax and spacing for novice readability.

Without additional context or code provided (since the code seems to be cut in the end), the analysis is limited to these points.
