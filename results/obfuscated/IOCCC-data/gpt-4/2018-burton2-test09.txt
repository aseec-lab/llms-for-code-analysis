The given code is written in C language and defined with a main function which has two parameters: an integer and a pointer to an array of character pointers. This main function is typically used in C programs to send command line arguments into the program.

Here's what the code does:

1. Checks the first character of the first argument to see if it's a quotation mark (").

2. If the first character is indeed a quotation mark, it then checks the second character of the first argument.

3. If the second character is 'a', it prints out "a" then breaks out of the switch statement.

4. If the second character is 'b', it prints out "b" then breaks out of the switch statement.

5. After the switch statement, it has two comments

6. A while loop is then run, which decrements the parameter 'ac' (initially the number of command line arguments) and checks if it is more than zero. As long as 'ac' is more than zero, the current value of ac is printed.

7. The program ends with returning 0, indicating successful execution of the program.

This seems like a very rudimentary command line argument checker. Its functionality will be much clearer given its use in a wider context of code and with proper command line arguments. Keep in mind that the behavior of the program may vary based on what kind of arguments are passed from the command line as parameters at the runtime.
