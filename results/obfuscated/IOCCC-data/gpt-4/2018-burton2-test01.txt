The given code is a C programming language code, it defines the "main" function, which is the primary function that gets executed when the code is run.

The main function accepts two parameters:
1. An integer, ac, which stands for argument count
2. A double pointer, av, which stands for argument vector - it's an array of pointers to arrays (strings), typically used for command line arguments.

The "if" condition checks if the first character of the first argument is a double-quote ("). If it is, it performs a switch-case where it checks the second character of the same argument. 

- If it is 'a', it prints 'a', and then it breaks the switch-case.
- If it is 'b', it prints 'b', and then it breaks the switch-case. 
- For any other character, it doesn't do anything.

Then in the following while loop, as long as "ac" (the count of command line arguments) is more than zero, it prints the value of "ac". It then decreases the value of "ac" by 1 on each iteration. 

The function ends by returning 0, which stands for successful execution.

To clarify, the way this program is written, the first argument (av[0]) will likely be the program name itself, not an argument provided by the user. Depending on your system setup, av[0] might or might not include the double-quotes around the program name in the first character. 

The while loop prints the numbers in reverse order starting from the number of command-line arguments minus 1 (not including the program itself as an argument) down to 1. 

It's worth mentioning that, in this code, calls of `printf()` lacks terminating semicolons (`;`), which leads to syntax errors. Also, `main` should be properly declared as `int main(int ac, char **av)` to follow good programming practices and standards.
