This program appears to have been obfuscated intentionally, possibly for a coding competition or as a security measure. However, it seems to be a type of C program that performs mathematical calculations based on the input given. 

The program employs macros to simplify the code and make it more readable. Macros in C are fragment of code which has been given a name. It uses a preprocessor directive (#define) to create macros 

The program seems to use a technique called "recursive function calling", this is used to break a big problem into smaller, manageable sub-problems. 

The function main() seems to take integer inputs and outputs a result based on those inputs. 

To be more specific, this code needs to be thoroughly studied line by line, as the obfuscation can make it hard to understand what is really happening.
