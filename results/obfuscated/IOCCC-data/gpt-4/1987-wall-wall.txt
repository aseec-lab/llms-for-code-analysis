This code, though quite obfuscated, is written in C language. It defines some preprocessor macros, declares some global variables, functions and a function pointer array and includes the standard I/O library. It uses many function pointers, preprocessor macros, and has quite a cryptic style. The main method of the program starts the execution by calling the first function in the function pointer array "vi". 

Due to its obfuscated nature, it's challenging to understand the specific actions and purposes without more context or comments. The variables, macro, and function names are also not self-explanatory, making understanding it very difficult without thoroughly analyzing it. The suite of functions may create, modify or analyze specific data, depending on the logic embedded into each function execution path. 

Without a detailed line by line analysis, it's hard to say exactly what this code does other than that it potentially manipulates and interacts with data input/output based on certain conditions programmed into it. It is also worth mentioning that functions like `exit()` and `gets()` are used, which typically are related to stopping a program and getting input respectively. 

This code is a great example of what is known as "Obfuscated C Code". Obfuscation in code is done to make the code harder to understand, read, and reverse engineer. This can sometimes be seen in coding competitions where the goal is to write the most confusing and convoluted yet functional code, or in serious applications to prevent reverse engineering of proprietary algorithms.
