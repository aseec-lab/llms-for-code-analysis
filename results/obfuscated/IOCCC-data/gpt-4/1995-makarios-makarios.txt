This C language code represents a program that calculates octal palindromes. A palindromic number is a number that remains the same when its digits are reversed. And an octal number is a number in base 8.

The program starts from 1 and increments upwards continuously, checking each number to see if it is an Octal Palindrome. If a number is found that is an Octal Palindrome, it prints that number in octal format.

Here's how the program functions internally:

1. The loop increments the variable 'n' starting from 1 (due to the while(i=++n) ) until it finds an octal palindrome.

2. For each 'n', the program generates its octal reversed version in the variable 'a' (with a=a*8 + i%8, i/=8) .

3. By the condition 'a==i | a/8==i', it checks whether 'n' is an octal palindrome. It evaluates to true if 'n' in octal format is a palindrome.

4. If this holds, it checks whether the original number has a divisor in the range from 2 to n-1 (using condition n-++m). If 'n' is divisible by any such 'm' (means, n is not prime), it breaks the loop and get next 'n'.

5. The numbers that pass all these checks (octal palindrome and prime) are then printed out in octal format using printf("%o\n",n).

In summary, it prints out octal palindromes. These numbers remain the same even when the order of its digits are reversed, also they are prime numbers.
