This program appears to be written in C and utilizes the Xlib library for drawing graphics on Unix/Linux display servers.

The main purpose of the program seems to be:

- It takes three arguments: "pixel clock", "carrier frequency" and "horizontal total". These are then converted to a floating-point number (for pixel clock and carrier frequency) and an integer (for the horizontal total). 
- It attempts to open a display using Xlib by calling XOpenDisplay(""), if it fails, the program exits.
- It creates a full screen window with attributes like ExposureMask and ButtonPressMask activated. The window is also set to override its redirect, which means that this window always stays on top.
- A new Graphic Context (GC) is created.
- It then enters a loop where it reads characters from the standard input, translates each character into an integer using an internal lookup table _X_[], and calls the function l(). 
- Inside the function l(), it uses the Xlib functions to draw points or fill rectangles on the created window depending on the input values. Some sort of pattern drawing is carried out using some mathematical calculations.
- For each iteration of the loop, the program sleeps for a while.
- Once its done, it frees up the resources by destroying the window and closing the connection to the X server and then exits.

It appears to be some sort of command-line based graphic demonstration or pattern display program. However, without proper comments, specific purpose cannot be determined. Some aspects of the code are obfuscated, like variable names are single characters, and magic numbers are used extensively, making it difficult to understand the exact purpose of the code.
