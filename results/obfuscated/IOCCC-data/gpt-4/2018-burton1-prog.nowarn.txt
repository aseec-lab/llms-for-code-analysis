This code is written in C. Its functionality seems to be reading characters from standard input until it can't read more (like until it faces an EOF), then for each character, if it's a control character (whose ASCII value is lower than or equal to 32, or it's DEL (127)), it will replace it with '.', otherwise it will keep the original character. It converts these characters into hexadecimal and stores in an array until it reaches a length of 16 (one row of a hexadecimal dump), at which point it will print the hexadecimal representation of these characters to standard output, and also the actual characters (only the printable ones, the non-printable ones are replaced with '.') in the same row, then continue to do the same for the next 16 characters and so on.

Note that it's not a working code as posted. There likely are some syntax errors as there seem to be missing some semicolons and parentheses. But the description above is based on an assumption of a most probable representation of the actual working code based on this snippet. For example the correct representation might be:

```c
int O;
char o[17];
int main(int l,char**v) {
    for(~l; O?O:puts(o), O=(O[o]=~(l=getchar())? (4<(4^l>>5))?l:46 :0)?(-~O)&printf("%02x ",l)*5:!O;)
    ;
    return !v;
}
```

This code is a representation of a hexdump program. That is, it outputs the hexadecimal representation of the input it reads. Hexdumps are used in debugging and reverse-engineering to see exactly what bytes are being operated on.
