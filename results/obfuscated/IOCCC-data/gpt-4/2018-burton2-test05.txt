This is a C program that appears to have multiple missing elements and errors, so it cannot be run or interpreted. 

1. The `int b` declaration in the first line is not completed, there is no semicolon (;) at the end. 

2. The `char a[]` declaration seems to be trying to declare a character array storing a string, but this string is malformed. It seems intended to store a string which, when printed, presents itself as another C function that prints "Hello, World!"  

3. The int main() function is trying to print the string stored in a. However, the syntax is incorrect. It is missing a closing parenthesis and a semicolon.

4. There seems to be a stray comment indicator (`//`) inside the `char a[]` declaration. This, however, does not actually serve as a comment indicator because it is inside a string.

If these syntax errors are cleaned up, the intended code would look something like this:

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int b;

char a[] = "main() { return printf(\"Hello, World!\n\"); }";

int main() {
printf("%s\n", a);
return 0;
}
```

In this case, the program would declare a variable `b`, a string `a` containing a different 'main' function, and then, in the real 'main' function, print the contents of `a` (i.e., print the text of the other main function which prints "Hello, World!") as output. The purpose or use of `b` is unknown from this code.
