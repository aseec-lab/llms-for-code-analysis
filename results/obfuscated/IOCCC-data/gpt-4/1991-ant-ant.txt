The given code is a minimalistic form of a text editor written in C. This editor allows you to make changes to a file by applying single-character commands similar to those found in the 'vi' editor.

Main features include:

   - Loading a text file into the editor for viewing and modifying
   - Moving the cursor around the loaded text
   - Adding, deleting, and replacing characters
   - Saves modified text back to the file
   - Supports basic text navigation commands similar to 'vi' ('h', 'j', 'k', 'l')

This program doesn't interact with the underlying filesystem to fetch or manage files. Instead, the file to edit must be passed as a command-line argument when starting the program.

Here's how some of the code works:

- The program starts by loading the file content into a buffer. The buffer is then modified as per user inputs without affecting the original file.
- At the end, the contents of the buffer are written back to the file, replacing the original content with the modified version.
- Several functions are defined to handle different commands: cursor movement, line navigation, removing or adding characters, clearing the display, and more. All these functions use curses library for handling terminal input/output.
- All commands are single-character and aren't displayed as you type them (noecho()), thanks to the curses library.
- Function pointers are used to map the single-character commands to their respective functions.
- The main loop continually updates the display and handles the user input until the quit command is given. After that, the file is saved and the program ends.
   
To sum up, while it's a rudimentary text editor, this program showcases buffer management, file I/O, terminal input/output handling, pointer arithmetic, and function pointers in C.
