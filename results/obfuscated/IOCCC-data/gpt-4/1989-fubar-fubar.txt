The provided code, being written in C and shell-script language, does the following:

1. First block (C code):
   - It's a main function that awaits command line inputs. 
   - The function initializes QQ and TT as 1, and an array of characters `qq[7]` and `tt[12]`. 
   - It also checks if the value passed as the argument is equal to QQ (which is 1) after being incremented by one; If true, it prints a factorial message and stops execution.
   - It enters a loop to read characters from the standard input until EOF (End of File) is encountered.
   - Inside the loop, it checks for certain conditions where characters read match 'Q' or 'T' and outputs certain information based on those conditions.
   - It reads 6 characters into `qq` array when two consecutive 'Q' are found, or reads 11 characters into `tt` array when two consecutive 'T's are found, and then outputs incremented value of `qq` or `tt` multiplied with QQ.
   - Every character that does not fit any of the above conditions is simply outputted.
  
2. cc ouroboros.c -o x:
   - This is a shell command that compiles the C file named 'ouroboros.c' and outputs the executable file as 'x'.

3. Rest of the lines are shell script code which are currently commented:
   - The shell script reads contents of ouroboros.c, pipes it to the 'x' executable with a command line argument and stores the output in 'x1' file.
   - It checks for successful execution, if not, it stops execution.
   - Then, it replaces 'ouroboros.c' with 'x1', makes 'ouroboros.c' executable, and runs 'ouroboros.c' with a command line argument. 

Note: This code seems to be having errors such as missing commas and missing parenthesis at 'int c' in struct, etc. Make sure to debug the code before executing.
