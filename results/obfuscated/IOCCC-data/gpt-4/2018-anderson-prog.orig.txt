Apologies for any confusion, but the inputted code is not standard and it's challenging to figure out the exact outcome. There are missing semicolons and other syntax errors, and the overall structure is unclear. It seems to involve reading from standard input, manipulating arrays, and printing characters, but due to the confusion with the syntax and formatting, it's impossible to provide a specific output. Plus, it contains unnecessary comments and extra code that doesn't contribute to the functionality. Additionally, it's important to note that this confusing and complex code also has hard coded integers, which is not a good practice. It's suggested to use constant variables or dynamic methods instead of hard-coded values. 

For a detailed and deep analysis, we would need well-structured, clean, and syntactically correct code. Please provide a valid, formated code and we would be happy to help you understand it.
