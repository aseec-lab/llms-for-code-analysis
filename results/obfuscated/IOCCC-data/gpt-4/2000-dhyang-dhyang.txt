This code is written in C and it's an example of an obfuscated program. 

The program defines a global constant named X, a global pointer to char named 'd', which is pointing to a long string of seemingly random characters, and declares a number of global integer variables.

When the main function runs, it starts with initializing two variables to zero, obtains a character from the obfuscated string using the function 's', and enters a loop which goes through each character in the string 'd'.

It contains several functions:

- `n()`: Returns the character in the obfuscated string at an index calculated using the current position and some computation logic depending on the position. It alters several global variables in the process.
- `s()`: Returns the next non-space character in the obfuscated string by repeatedly calling `n()` until a non-space character is found. This function also updates the same global variable x used in n().
- `main()`: Orchestration function that handles the setup, calls `n()` and `s()` to interpret the obfuscated string, and finally print the result of the operation.

This obfuscated program seems to output the same program when ran. It is likely to be an example of a quine, a non-empty computer program which takes no input and produces a copy of its own source code as its only output. Quines are curious and interesting puzzles in computer programming, particularly for the study of compilers and interpretation.
