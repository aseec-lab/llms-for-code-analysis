This code seems to be written in C and is a game with quite an intricate terminal-based graphics implementation, where each object and element is represented with ASCII art and characters.

In particular, it seems to be a type of Sokoban game, a classic puzzle game where the player needs to push boxes into specific locations. 

Here are the key points:

1.  A 2D array `M[12][22]` represents the game map, where each character signifies a specific type of cell. It seems like `A` signifies an empty space, `B` is a walkable or movable tile, `C`, `D`, `E`, `F`, `G` are some sort of objects (possibly boxes and their target locations), `I`, `J`, `K` maybe doors or keys, and `L` could be a type of placeholder or empty box.

2. The characters `MNOH` in the `O` string are the player's current direction.

3. The characters `hjkl` in the `k` string are probably the control keys to move the player in different directions. `h` is left, `j` is down, `k` is up, `l` is right.

4. The game sets up a curses window using `initscr()`, `clear()`, `noecho()`, `cbreak()`. 

5. It then enters into a game loop where it keeps updating the game board and checking for user input until the user runs out of moves.

6. If the user gets all the boxes to their locations without running out of moves, it displays `Well done!`, otherwise, it displays `Too many moves`.

This information is based on the common characteristics of a Sokoban game and assumptions made after analyzing the C code presented. Some specific details may vary as the implementation and game rules can be different- the whole game code would need to be present to fully understand it. The ASCII art and puzzles in the game could lead to a much more dynamic and potentially different game than a simple Sokoban game!
