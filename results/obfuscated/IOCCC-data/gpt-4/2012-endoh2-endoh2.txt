This C program is a more complex form of quine because it is a function-level quine in the form of `pi` or `e`. A quine is a non-empty computer program which takes no input and produces a copy of its own source code as its only output. When you run this program with either `pi` or `e` as a command-line argument, it generates its own source code where certain parts of source code are represented in that respective mathematical constant's decimal form.

Interestingly, this cumulative effect is achieved using a form of decimal output known as "spigot" output. The spigot refers to the algorithm used to slowly but surely 'spigot out' the digits of `pi` or `e`. 

In the program, we can see it uses `calloc` to allocate memory for numbers in spigot form. It then uses several for loops to continuously calculate each digit of `pi` or `e`, and at the same time constructs the program source code from these digits. The source code representation is split into three parts, the first part repeats irrespective of the input while the second and third parts are dependent on the input (either 'pi' or 'e'). 

Although it's a clever exploit of C code behavior, please note it's a complex and convoluted code which isn't a good representation of modular, easy-to-read and maintain code.
