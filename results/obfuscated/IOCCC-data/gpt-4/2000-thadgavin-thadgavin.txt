The provided code is written in C. It's pretty complex and not very well documented, so there's some degree of inference involved in understanding it.

At a high level, this code is generating a series of images based on mathematical computations. These images are the output of the fractal functions the code defines, which include sine and square root functions, among others. The computations involve a lot of trigonometry and use the variables defined at the start of the code to generate different patterns.

The main part of the code first initializes the image generation process with F(0), then enters a loop that produces an arbitrary number of images.

The work is divided into two parts: calculation and image generation. In the first for loop, the code generates the parameters for the fractal functions based on the x and y coordinate positions.

The calculations include taking the square root of the sum of the squares of the x and y coordinates and taking the arc tangent of the x coordinate and the y coordinate.

The code also uses a noise generation process using pseudo-random changes for the variables.

In the second for loop, the code generates the images based on the previously calculated parameters. It uses the sine function and the parameters to decide the color intensity for each pixel, before using the function F(8) which depending on the compiled version of the code will either use the DOS, SDL or NCURSES library to display these images.

After each image is drawn, some of the base parameters are adjusted to change the pattern for the next render. This loop continues indefinitely, creating a rotating fractal animation. 

Please note that without a specific output context (like a particular screen configuration or an SDL window, for instance) this code won't actually do anything visible when run. It's dependent on being integrated into a larger system that can handle and display its outputs.  

The exact nature of the images being rendered cannot be definitely determined from the code alone as it depends on the initial settings of the parameters and their updates during the animation.
