The provided code is highly obfuscated C code. It is using a preprocessor directive '#define' to replace certain keywords in the main body of the code with a very unusual naming scheme. #define is a preprocessor directive in C programming language that lets you define symbolic names and constants which could be used later in the code.

Because the programmer has chosen to replace an abundance of common characters with non-standard keywords, it's very complex to understand what exactly the code is doing without a considerable amount of time and effort spent to completely replace all the defined keywords with their original values. It's quite possible that the code is simply an exercise in obfuscation and is simply designed to confuse programmers by being difficult to read and understand. 

On the chance you find obfuscated code like this running in a production environment, it would be best to refactor it into something much more readable and maintainable. Such obfuscation can make maintenance and debugging exceptionally challenging and time-consuming. 

Please remember that good code is usually self-explanatory, and the intention behind every line of code should be easily understood by others. Sufficient commenting and relevant variable naming can make the code more readable and maintainable.
