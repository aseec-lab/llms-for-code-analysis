This code block seems like a part of a C program with some syntactical issues. From the code, the following observations can be made:

- `char a`: This declares a character variable 'a'.
- `float b,c`: This declares two floating point variables 'b' and 'c'.
- `main(d): for ( ... ):` This is a malformed attempt at defining the main function and a for loop. 
    - Normally, the main function in C is written in the form `int main() {...}`, optionally taking int and char array arguments for command line parameters (`int main(int argc, char *argv[]){...}`).
    - The 'for' loop definition is also malformed as the snippet provided includes neither semi-colons to separate its statements nor the complete statements. A complete 'for' loop would look like `for(initialization; conditional; increment){...}`.
    
- In the 'if' condition inside the for loop, 
    - `d>2e3*c?c=1,scanf(" %c%f",&a,&c),d=55-a%32*9/5,b=d>9,d=d%13-a/32*12:1` 
        - This is a ternary operatory acting as an if-else conditional : the condition to check is `d>2000*c`; if the condition is true, the following statements are executed; if the condition is false, it returns 1.
        - It does a scan input for character and float value, assigns the result of an expression to 'd', checks if 'd' is greater than 9, and then assigns another expression's result to 'd'.
        
- Then it manipulates 'a' and 'b' using some arithmetic operations under the condition of `++d<24`:

- In the last part, 
    - `a=2)++d<24?b*=89/84.:putchar(a=b*d)` 
        - There is an another ternary operation if `++d<24` is true, then it multiplies 'b' by 89 divided by 84, otherwise character pointer is assigned as product of 'b' and 'd'.
        - But this entire operation seems erroneous in terms of syntax.
        
Note: 
As it is, the program contains several syntax errors and would not compile. Also, the logic of the `if` conditions and calculation seems complex without clear documentation, which makes the code difficult to read and maintain. It's recommended to refactor this code with sufficient explanations or comments, proper variable names reflecting their purposes, and improved program flow.
