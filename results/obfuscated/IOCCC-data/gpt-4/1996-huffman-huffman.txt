The provided code is a sophisticated example of obfuscated C code, where all the names are replaced by macros, and it uses non-trivial control flows and operations. Although difficult to analyze fully without extensive work, we can understand a broad view.

1. It begins by defining several macros which replace common language constructs to obscure the code's appearance. For example, `#define x char` is replacing `char` with `x`, `#define z else` is replacing `else` with `z`, `#define w gets` is replacing `gets` with `w`, and so on.

2. Then, it declares a primary function `s()`, which, due to macro substitution, corresponds to `main()` function. 

3. It appears to be working with arrays of characters (`x` or `char` type in non-obfuscated code), defined using variable b and c, and arrays of integers (`u` or `int` type), defined using variables a, d, and e. It accepts input via the `gets` function (replaced by 'w') and processes it by shifting, inequality checks, combining, etc.

4. The two primary loop conditions in the code—`r (0 [b] -7 * 5)` and `r ((-0) [ c ] && w (b + 8 * 5* 3) && w (b +8 *5 * 6))`—appear to be performing some checks that determine the flow of execution.

5. The strings are processed and manipulated, probably performing cryptographic or encoding operations.

6. Different operations are performed in various code branches depending on the conditions met, like transforming characters to upper case, comparisons with ASCII values, shift operations, etc. The transformed characters or strings are then output using `putchar` function (replaced by 'v').

7. One section appears to process the string as a Braille representation; it converts the comprising characters according to their ASCII values and generates another representation.

To provide the full & specific insight of what this code does, we'll need to substitute macros with their corresponding standard symbols, then decode & analyze the complex operations and control flows embedded. A detailed line by line tracing would be needed, possibly in a debugging tool. Without the broader context or more clear comments/documentation, interpreting the original intent of obfuscated code can be chalk-like challenging.
