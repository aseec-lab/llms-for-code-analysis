This code is written in a very obfuscated manner which makes it really hard to analyze it. It seems that part of the code is missing or out of order. Some parts look like they are defining different functions and variables using a different way of writing. Some parts are using bitwise operators and others are using ternary operators. However, because of the unusual format and lack of context, it's difficult to deduce the purpose of the code.

It's recommended to follow standard naming and programming conventions to make source code easier to read, maintain, and debug. This may include, but is not limited to, using meaningful variable names, commenting code logic, and organizing code into logical segments.Unfortunately, this code is even harder to understand than the previous part. It still does not follow standard programming conventions, making it very hard to deduce its purpose. It appears to contain an entry point for a program – the main function – where it appears to be seeding a random number generator with the current time and parsing command-line arguments. One command line argument 'F' is being parsed which might be used as a parameter in some function. 

As per the code, we have multiple nested functions calling each other with custom operator definitions.

Standard programming best practices suggest that source code should be readable and maintainable, hence it needs meaningful variable and function names, consistent formatting, and thorough commenting. This code obscures its logic and operations through unusual formatting and naming, and thus would be exceedingly difficult to maintain, debug, or extend with new functionality. It's an example of obfuscated code which is often used in programming contests or for fun to make the program difficult to understand.
