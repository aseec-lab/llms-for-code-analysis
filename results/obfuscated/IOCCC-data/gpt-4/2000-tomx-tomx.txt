The given code is a combination of a Makefile code snippet and a simple C program.

The Makefile part is used for compiling and cleaning up a C project. It defines a simple means of compiling a C source file into an executable, named 'tomx', using the 'cc' compiler designated by the 'CC' variable.

- "CC=cc" declares that the compiler to be used is cc.
- "PROG=tomx" defines the program name.
- "%:%.c" is a rule that matches a target filename without an extension to a corresponding source file with a .c extension.
- "$(CC) $< -o $@" is the command line to compile a .c file into an executable. "$<" and "$@" are automatic variables in make, where "$<" is the names of the dependencies (input) and "$@" is the name of the target (output).
- The 'clean' target removes the created executable file. It is a common convention to have a clean target in makefiles that removes generated files.
- ".PHONY" is used to declare 'clean' as a phony target. This means it doesn't represent a file name, but just a way of naming a process.

The C portion of the code contains the main function that prints "Hello, world" to the console. The "return !printf("Hello, world\n")" statement prints the message and returns 0 if the print is successful or otherwise 1. The '!' operator inverts the result of printf, which returns the number of characters printed.
