This is a very complex piece of code written in C and appears to be from the International Obfuscated C Code Contest (IOCCC). Obfuscated code is intentionally designed to be complicated, unreadable, and hard to understand.

The main function at the bottom is straightforward - it simply prints "hello world!" to the console when run.

However, the large block of code above is obfuscated and does much more:

1. The #define statements are defining macros. These macros take input and give output according to the given definition. They are used for code abstractions and simplifications.

2. The code uses various system calls like `sys/ioctl.h`, `unistd.h`, `string.h`, `signal.h`, `stdlib.h`, and  `stdio.h`. 

   `sys/ioctl.h` and `unistd.h` are used for performing terminal Input/Output control. It is often used to change the settings of the terminal.

   `string.h` is used for manipulating arrays of characters.

   `signal.h` is the header for the signal interface.

   `stdlib.h` is the general purpose standard library which includes functions involving memory allocation, process control, conversions, and others.

   `stdio.h` is used for Input/Output operations like reading a file or printing a string.

3. The code is trying to generate random alphanumeric characters based on some calculations and specific strings of characters defined in the code.

4. The code also interacts with user input and terminal outputs.

The exact operation of this program is difficult to determine without thoroughly de-obfuscating and debugging the code which would be non-trivial due to the complex nature of the obfuscation.
