This is a complex piece of C code written in an obfuscated style for brevity and to make it harder to understand. In general, it performs parsing of a string to decipher a type of expression. The string is given in a postfix notation similar to the declarations used in the C++ language.

Here is a breakdown of each part of the program:

1. The code first defines three macros (`w`, `p`, and `t`). `w` refers to the printf() function, `p` indicates a while loop, and `t` calls a function `T()`.
   
2. The `D()` function is a recursive function. This function is used to parse the postfix notation of the declaration.

3. `T()` function scans the elements from the string, skipping whitespace. It returns either a character type, `9` for alphabetic (a name), `32` for a number, or a symbol.

4. In the `main()` function, it continually prompts the user for input, gets the string input, and then starts the parsing procedure.

Keep in mind that this is a simplified and high-level overview, the actual parsing and processing mechanics of the code go beyond using several standard and conditional operations. It's an example of complex pointer manipulation and short-code writing style in C. In reality, code like this would not be considered good practice due to its lack of readability and maintainability.
