This is a C program that generates the so-called "Kolakoski sequence" (1, 2, 2, 1, 1, 2, 1, 2, 2...) on standard output. Each digit in the output represents the number of consecutive times (runs) that digit should appear. The first digit is always 1, and the sequence only consists of 1s and 2s.

In details: 

The program starts by defining a string and an array. The array (l) is initialized with a huge string of numerical characters. It also defines the main function and inside it, it defines several long integer variables.

It includes a primary while loop that iterates as long as the variable 'i' is less than the size of the array 'l'. Inside this loop, it initializes several more long integer variables and an array 'y'.

A nested while loop increments 'v' until it's equal to 'i'. If the condition inside this loop holds true, it modifies the values of 'w' and 'k'.

The next while loop executes as long as 'u' is less than 'k'. Inside this loop, it performs several mathematical operations on the variables 'u', 'v', and 'x', and increments the pointer 's'.

Within the last while loop, it evaluates a couple of mathematical expressions with 'u', 'v', 'k', 'y', and 'j'. If the condition holds true, it decrements 'x' by 'w'.

Finally, the 'putchar' function prints out the resulting value of 'j' (if not zero) plus 32, or a newline character (10 in the ASCII table) if 'j' is zero. Afterwards, the array 'l' at index 'i' is set to the value of 'j', and 'i' is incremented.

When all loops have finished running and all the characters have been printed out, the program returns 0 to indicate a successful run.

In summary, this is a complex algorithm for generating the Kolakoski sequence. It uses minimal space by reusing variables and performing in-place updates wherever possible.
