This code appears to be a mix of valid and invalid C code, and seems to have been obfuscated. Here is what each piece appears to be doing, at least theoretically:

1. Macro Definitions: This piece of code defines several macros that replace key language words with others. These replacements are unconventional and make the code harder to understand.

2. extern int floor: This statement is an external declaration for a function or a variable named 'floor'. However, without a type like 'int', this statement is invalid.

3. Double Function: It creates a function named 'double' that takes two arguments and returns an integer. However, the body of the function isn't provided.

4. struct tag: This statement defines a structure 'tag' with an integer member 'x0' and a pointer to an integer 'xO'. Then it declares a pointer 'main' to 'tag' structure.

5. Main Function: The function called 'main' takes three arguments: 'i', 'dup', and 'signal'. This is unconventional as the standard 'main' function takes either zero or two arguments in the form 'int main()' or 'int main(int argc, char *argv[]).

The loops and conditions inside the function are quite complex, and doing so many replacements with macros makes it hard to tell what the actual logic is.

Overall, it's tough to decipher what this code does due to macros substituting standard C keywords and the unconventional use of syntax. It appears to be purposefully obfuscated or it might be incorrectly written or incomplete.
