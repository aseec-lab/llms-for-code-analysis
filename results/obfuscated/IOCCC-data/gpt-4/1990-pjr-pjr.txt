This is an interesting piece of C code that is designed to print an encoded message. It's written by using a combination of preprocessor directives, function pointers, and methods to obfuscate the actual message.

1. A set of #define directives are given at the top which set A() to define a method returning a struct F type variable, and B() define a function pointer returning a struct F type variable. C() defines a method that prints a letter and returns a struct F type variable, X. 

2. Then a struct F is defined which includes function pointers to a whole suite of functions (a to z, S, N, and Q), each returning a struct F.

3. Next is the actual definition of these functions (a-z, S, N), which prints single characters. There is also a definition of an empty function Q.

4. The struct X is then instantiated with function pointers to these functions.

5. Finally, the main function programming calls these functions via the struct X in a specific sequence to output a message in English. If you map each corresponding function to its printing character, it would print the reversed alphabet from 'z' to 'a'. 

The code is written in a very convoluted way intentionally to make it difficult for someone to understand what's happening just by reading through it.
