This code is written in C and looks a bit convoluted and unreadable due to a lack of spacing and indentation. However, we can still find its functionality.

Each chunk belongs to a different kind of IO obfuscation "style" and the actual style to be used is determined by a macro 'IDX' provided at compile time.

The code consists of a preprocessor directive. If IDX is defined as 1, the code inside #if IDX==1 and #endif will be compiled; for IDX == 2, the code inside #elif IDX==2 will be compiled; and so forth. The IDX value dictates the data manipulation logic and parameters for the main() function.

Each main() function processes an unlimited number of bytes from the standard input and executes an obfuscated algorithm on them. They appear to generate sort of random permutations and outputting the result. The permutations and criteria seem to depend on the given IDX value. 

It takes a character from the standard input, transforms it in some way, and increments the index where to store the next value. If there's no more input or the program reaches the end of its buffer, it starts outputting the twisted input back to the standard output.

In summary, it is an obfuscated C code that reads from the standard input, performs certain operations including random permutations on the data, and writes to the standard output. The specifics of these operations are dictated by the value of IDX set at compile time, creating different obfuscation 'styles'.
