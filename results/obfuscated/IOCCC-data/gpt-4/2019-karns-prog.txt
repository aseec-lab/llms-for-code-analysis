This C program reads a maze from the standard input, solves that maze, and outputs the solution. The maze is ASCII-based where '@' is the starting point, '!' is the ending point, and '#' are walls. You can input space for paths.

Here are the sections of the program does:

1. It first includes the necessary libraries: stdio.h, stdlib.h, and unistd.h.

2. Defines a char array '_int' containing ASCII codes for specific characters, and various function pointers to standard library functions for IO operations, heap memory management, and string formatting.

3. In 'main()', it starts by allocating memory for some dynamic variables using 'malloc'.

4. It then enters a series of 'goto' sections, which control the flow of the program.

5. In 'cow' section, it reads the input array from stdin, figuring out where beginning ('@') and end ('!') are, and builds an internal representation of the maze.

6. The 'pic' section sets up state for the maze-solving algorithm, including an array recording the path taken through the maze.

7. The 'tokyo' section implements a breadth-first search algorithm to find the shortest path through the maze.

8. The 'wow' and 'chin' sections are sub-sections of 'tokyo', handling different cases in the maze traversal algorithm.

9. The 'z' section provides a visual depiction of the solution - it draws the path taken directly onto the maze by replacing characters in the maze arrays with characters which represent the path.

10. If the path reaches the end of the maze ('!'), it jumps to the 'tww' section where it outputs the final solved maze with the path from start to end.

11. The 'ten' and 'pio' control the termination of the code.

It's worth noting that this code's style is somewhat unorthodox, utilizing a lot of 'goto' statements and pointer arithmetic, which can make it more challenging to understand. 

Also, the characters that represent walls and paths in the maze might differ based on the ASCII values in the '_int' array. Please check the array for clarity.
