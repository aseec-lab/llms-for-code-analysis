This program is a representation of IOCCC (International Obfuscated C Code Contest) 2015's winning entry by Yusuke Endoh "mame". It is a "quined" esoteric Brainfuck interpreter implemented in the C language. 

A "quine" is a non-empty computer program which takes no input and produces a copy of its own source code as its only output. Meanwhile, Brainfuck is an esoteric programming language created in 1993 which consists of only eight simple commands, a data pointer, and an instruction pointer. 

This program accepts Brainfuck code as an input and interprets it. For example, the Brainfuck equivalent of Hello World! is "+[-[<<[+[--->+<]>>]<<]<.>>>+[-<+>]>>>>>>>.>>>>>+." - if you feed this as an input to the IOCCC's program, it will output "Hello, World!".

The quining process and structure of the code make it particularly hard to read and understand - this is a requirement of the competition. The extensive use of macros and bitwise operations further obfuscate the code.
