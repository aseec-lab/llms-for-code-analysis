The provided code appears to be broken up and not provided sequentially; certain lines are repeated, and the syntax is generally incorrect and incomplete (for example, variable declarations are separated by a new line, the function main doesn't close correctly, etc.), so it's impossible to provide a complete analysis of what this code does.

From what I can tell, however, a few things can be deduced:

1. It seems to involve manipulation of arrays of types `char` (`char* d, A[9876]`, `*ad, a, c`) and some mathematical operations.
2. The `main` function seems to take two arguments, `n` and `V`.
3. There are several bitwise operations, such as `<<`.
4. Code includes usage of the `srand` function, which is used in C to seed the pseudo-random number generator that is used by the function `rand`.
5. The `write` function is used, which writes data into a file descriptor.
6. There is a usage of recursion as `main` function in its body calls itself `!main`.

However, without the complete, correct version of this code, this analysis cannot be guaranteed to be 100% accurate.
