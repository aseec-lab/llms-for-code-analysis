This C code is obfuscated, a common practice for the International Obfuscated C Code Contest (IOCCC). The purpose of obfuscation is to make the code as unreadable and cryptic as possible. The given code seems to define a GM (Gregorian calendar), via numerous macros.

Each macro definition and the declared variables are used to compute the date of Easter for a given year within the range from 1582 to 2200 based on the Gregorian calendar. This is then printed to the console in the format: "Day Mon DD YYYY", where Day is the weekday, Mon is the month, DD is the day of the month, and YYYY is the year.

The `strftime` function formats the time represented in a `struct tm` (which is what 's' is) to `T` array. 

The #includes are for `time.h` which provides time and date functions and `stdio.h` which is used for input/output functions. The `errno.h` include file is included but it's not being used in the code.

The `_POSIX_SOURCE` defined at the start of code is a feature test macro which provides access to functionalities proposed by the POSIX standard. However, its use in this context is a bit unclear since there aren't any POSIX specific features being used. The actual interpretation of the obfuscated code may vary but this is a general high-level interpretation of its functionalities. The actual execution might involve some intricate details because of the obfuscation.
