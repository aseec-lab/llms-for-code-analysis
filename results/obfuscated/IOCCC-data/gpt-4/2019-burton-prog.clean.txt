This code is a bit obscure due to its unconventional style. It seems to be written in the C programming language. This code has syntax errors and it won't compile. I will try to give you a general interpretation of what this code could potentially do if it were written correctly.

- Several static integer variables are declared at the beginning of the code: `e`, `n`, `j`, `o`, `y`.

- `main()` function is defined, which is the entry point for a C program.

- Inside `main()`, there's a loop runs indefinitely, or until a break or return statement is reached.

- In the iterations of the loop, `n` is set to the increment (`-~`) of the ASCII value of the next character read from the standard input (`getchar()`).

- It seems to be checking for some conditions based on specific ASCII ranges and increase the counts (`e`, `j`).

- Finally it prints the `e`, `j`, `y` after modifying `e` and `j`.

However, we can't be absolutely sure about the functioning and intent behind the code as it's not properly structured and the symbol `012` (octal for decimal number 10) is used which seems obscure. A proper context or a correct version of the code will be helpful in understanding the exact behavior of the program.
