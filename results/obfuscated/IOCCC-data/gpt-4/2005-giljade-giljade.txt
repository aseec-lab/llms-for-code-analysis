This code appears to be written in C language, with a heavy use of macros and obfuscation techniques like inserting lots of nascent space to make it hard to read and understand.

1. This code uses a lot of preprocessing directives #define for rearranging and obfuscating the logic.

2. It defines a complex structure of character arrays, long integer arrays, and bunch of long integer variables. 

3. The purpose of the 'H()', 'I()', and 'o()' macros seems to be bit manipulation and rearrangement of the character arrays.

4. `main()` function seems to open the file, read it, parse it, do certain operations based on the logic of macros defined, increase and decrease pointers, use system calls to execute certain commands.

5. Based on the use of `sprintf()` and `system()` calls, it seems to be generating script commands dynamically and executing them to transform the input script. 

6. It also seems to use output and error redirection in the invoked scripts.

7. There is a mix of reading from the file, generating scripts (possibly shell or another programming language), and executing them.

In an abstract form, it does parsing an input text file, manipulating its contents, and generating & executing scripts based on the input. Verification of what exactly the scripts do is not instantaneously determinable due to the complexity of the implemented logic.

Please, note that the structure of this code is highly unusual and often considered bad practice due to its unnecessary complexity and obfuscation. It is also incompatible with many modern C compilers.
