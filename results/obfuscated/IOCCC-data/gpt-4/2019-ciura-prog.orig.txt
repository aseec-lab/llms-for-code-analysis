This code is complex, obfuscated and not easily readable. Despite this, I can provide a general idea of what this code attempts to do. 

This code seems to implement an algorithm for manipulating string pointers and data using a wide variety of operators and pointer arithmetic. It uses wide characters (wchar_t) and wide character strings, which suggests that it could handle multi-byte character sets. 

Main function takes in two command line arguments. The code has a non-trivial use of macro definitions to write the main functions, and it heavily uses bitwise operations and pointer arithmetic which could make the overall program logic quite complex. 

For example, the '#define P 9<<23^1' is defining P as an integer whose value is (9 left shifted 23 places) XOR 1.

At the heart, this code has a dictionary/character set manipulation operation going on, but the overall purpose is not clear without any context as to what it does. 

The names of the identifiers used are single letters which makes it even more difficult to infer any semantic meaning from this code. High caution should be used when dealing with such code, particularly as there are several goto statements which can make control flow difficult to follow. 

Without more context or clearer variable names, the exact functionality is very difficult to discern. The code could be a part of a challenge, a cryptographic program, a text processing/parsing program, or something else entirely.
