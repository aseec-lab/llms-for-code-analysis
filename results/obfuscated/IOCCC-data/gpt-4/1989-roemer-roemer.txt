This code appears to be partially obfuscated. It's quite complex and formatted in a difficult to read way. The code seems to be written in C or C++, and seems to have several variables to store numbers related to Pi (like 3141592654 and 3.141), and it contains several for loops and 'if' conditions which manipulate these variables in various ways. Several functions and operations such as shifts, additions, divisions, and modulo operations are performed on these variables.

By deciphering the code, it seems it's meant to calculate numbers related to Pi, but it's not obvious what the exact purpose is, whether it prints out the calculated numbers, or uses them for further calculations. The code also contains write() function, which is a system call that writes to a file descriptor, in this case standard output, implying that this program may print out some values.

In sum, this appears to be a complex piece of code that performs mathematical operations related to the numerical value Pi and has an output, but the exact purpose and ultimate results are unclear due to the obfuscated format. 

However, it's worth mentioning that the code has several potential issues:
1. There are some lines starting or ending with an underscore which is a syntax error in C/C++.
2. The main function doesn't have a return type.
3. The "write" function is called with unusual (possibly wrong) arguments.
4. There are lines ending with operators, which is not valid C/C++ syntax.

These points and the fact that the code doesn't adhere to general code styling practices suggests something is missing, or that this code might not compile or work as expected.
