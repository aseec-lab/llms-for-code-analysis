The provided C code appears to be a minimal web client that retrieves HTML from a given URL or local file and formats and outputs it as plain text. 

Here is the functionality of some specific sections of the code:
1. The code defines several macros at the start, which are then used throughout the code. This might be done to obfuscate the code or to make it shorter and less verbose.

2. It reads the sizes of a terminal window using the ioctl system call with the TIOCGWINSZ flag. This will be used later on when outputting text to the console.

3. It defines an array `w` with values 24 and 80, which seem to refer to the dimensions of a console window (height and width).

4. It initializes a `FILE` pointer `f` for file handling operations.

5. The function `e(c s)` checks if a string begins with '#', and converts the rest of the string to a long integer using strtol function. The function also checks for a  corelating string in array `S[][]` and returns corresponding value from `*S[]`.

6. The function `P(I x)` handles the printing of the extracted text to the console, respecting the dimensions of the console window, and breaking lines when needed.

7. The function `X(c s)` checks if a string matches a pattern.

8. The `main(I V, c *v)` function executes the main logic of the client. It handles terminal and file size gathering, HTML tag removal and formatting, making HTTP requests, and printing out the result.

9. The function `d(c s)` formats the outputted text by adding necessary line breaks.

10. The function `a(c s)` handles <a>, <img>, and some other HTML tags.

This program requires some UNIX headers that are not available in all operating systems, particularly Windows. Specifically, it needs to include `<sys/socket.h>`, `<netinet/in.h>` and `<netdb.h>`. It also needs the `ioctl` function for interacting with the terminal device, which is also UNIX-specific.

Your program parses text in a primitive way compared to full-featured HTML parsing libraries, but it might be okay for simple cases or for learning purposes.
