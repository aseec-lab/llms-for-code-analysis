This is a C program that appears to implement a simplified version of a build automation tool similar to the "make" command in Unix-like systems. 

This tool helps in automatically managing the build process of a target file from its dependencies using rules defined in a user-specified file (akin to a Makefile). 

Here's further details on the functions in the code:

1. `time_t M(char *f)`: This function receives a file name and returns the last modification time of the file.

2. `int T(char *f)`: This function receives a file name f and finds its matching rule in the ruleset. It returns the index of the rule or zero if no rule is found.

3. `void U(char *f)`: This function builds the target file from its dependencies using the rules defined in the Makefile-like file. If necessary, it recursively builds dependencies.

4. `int main(int u, char **v)`: The main entry to the program. It takes two arguments: the number of command-line arguments (u) and a pointer to an array that contains those arguments (v). It first checks whether the correct number of command-line arguments are given, and then it reads the rules from the Makefile-like file, processes them and builds the target file (or the first target in the Makefile-like file if none was given on the command line).

Note that due to missing parts of the code and various apparent syntax errors, the code itself would not compile as it stands.
