The provided code is written in C, but it's a bit hard to understand due to lack of adequate spacing, improper formatting and lack of comments which are essential for code readability. From what I can gather though, it's essentially printing out the prime factors of a number y, given as an argument to the main function, in some representation. Let's break it down:

- In the function `f(y,x)`, it's initializing variables `m` and `z` to be 1.
- It then enters a for loop where `m` is being incremented after each iteration. This continues until `m*m` is greater than `y`.
- Inside the loop, if `y` modulo `m` is not equal to 0 then `z` remains the same else `z` becomes `m`.
- `z` appears to hold the lowest prime factor of `y` at any given point in the loop.

This entire mechanism works on the principle that every composite number has at least one prime factor less than or equal to its square root

- If `x+1` is not zero, then a condition check on `z` is made: if `z` is less than 2, then another check on `x` is done to call `f(x,0)` if `x` is not zero, else print the ASCII character corresponding to `64`. 
- The ASCII value `64` corresponds to '@' character.

Main function `main(y){f(y-1,-1)}` is a bit strange, there should be no parameter in main function.  It should be like `int main(int argc, char *argv[])`.

Note: This code is likely not functional, as it's missing semi-colons and has a not correctly defined `main()` function. Once these errors are corrected, it might not behave exactly as described due to its complex, shorthand nature.
