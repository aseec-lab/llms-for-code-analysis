This is an obfuscated C program, which is not easy to understand because its variables, macros, and functions are named with single letters and it also uses some old C syntax. However, it can be seen that the program is intended to be used with command line arguments and seems to perform some kind of text pattern matching, similar to how regular expressions or "grep" works in unix/linux systems.

Below are some analysis of the main entities in this program:

1. It declares several macros at the top (Q, E, R, W, B, D, G), which are replacements for common keywords or operations in C like `if` (Q), `else` (E), `return` (R), `while` (W) and others.

2. The program includes multiple function declarations and definitions, including main() function which is the entry point.

3. In the `main` function, if there's not enough command line arguments, it'll print a usage message and return an error code.

4. The four `N()` function calls in the `main` function seem to initialize some program's internal state.

5. The `X()` function call seems to process the command line argument pointed by `*p`.

6. Then it enters a loop where it takes the filename from `*p`, opens it, and if the file opens successfully, it reads lines from the file using `fgets`.

7. For every line, the program calls `M(l)` function and if the returned value is non-zero, it prints the filename and the line.

8. After read all lines of the file or once input ends, it closes the file by `fclose(j)`.

Functions `X`, `T`, `F` and `L` are involved in processing some input (presumably the pattern for searching), while `N` is for storing some integers in an array 'a'. Function `O` seems to be incomplete or unused.

It is hard to provide a complete explanation of the program without the definitions of `M()`, `U()`, and `P()` functions, and without knowing precisely how and what `X()`, `T()`, `F()` and `L()` functions do with their input. 

Given the use of file handling and text/process patterns in the code, it can be inferred that this code might be used for reading in files and perhaps searching or sorting them based on some criteria or pattern matching. With the lack of comments and the obtuse naming, however, itâ€™s difficult to ascertain the precise purpose or functionality of this code.As the continuation of the previously analyzed C code, we can now understand what a few more of the functions do. Again, this source file is obfuscated, which means that the names of functions and variables are deliberately made hard to understand. 

1. Function `M(p)`: This function processes line by line (`p`) from file which is opened in `main` function and for each character in that line does some state transition. The `d` is a 2D array which is used to manage the state transitions based on the current/previous character. It is working like a finite state machine, maintaining a state's change based on the input characters from the file's content. The function returns a boolean type value indicating if state transition ended in a final (failing) state. 

2. Functions `P(p)` and `U(p)`: They perform boolean operations on the array `a[]` indexed by the contents of `p`. 

3. The `O` macro: It does some operation, not defined in the quoted code, on the argument or the indexed element from array `a[]`.

It's important to mention that array `a[]` and other variables like `o`, `b`, etc., have not been defined in this provided code block, hence, without full view of the source code and more context, the complete explanation and commentary on the code remains staggered and based on limited understanding. 

This obfuscated code seems to sacrifice readability, understanding, and maintainability for brevity. Even though it's valid C code, explaining and understanding it completely, especially at the functional level, requires substantial reverse-engineering efforts.
