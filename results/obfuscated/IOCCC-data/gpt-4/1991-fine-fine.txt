This is a C language function which implements a basic Caesar cipher for an input text string, where the shift value is fixed to 13 (i.e., each character in the text is replaced by a letter 13 positions ahead of it in the alphabet).

Here is a breakdown:

1. main(a,b): This is the main function where two variables 'a' and 'b' are declared.

2. while((a=getchar())+1): This is a while loop which will read each character from the input until EOF (end of the file). In C, the EOF is represented by -1 and adding 1 to it makes it 0, which will evaluate to false to break the loop.

3. putchar((b=64^a&223)&&b<27?a&96|(b+12)%26+1:a): 'putchar' is a function to write a character (expressed as a number) to stdout.

- (b=64^a&223): This expression performs a bitwise XOR between the ASCII value of 'a' and 64, and then performs a bitwise AND with 223 to make sure 'a' is in uppercase alphabet range.
  
- b<27: This checks if 'b' is an uppercase letter.

- a&96: This expression is used to preserve the case of the input character.

- |(b+12)%26+1: This is the Caesar cipher logic. It rotates the character 13 places ahead in the alphabet and wraps around if the end of the alphabet is reached. 

- The '?' and ':' form a conditional operator. If 'b<27' is true then it performs the Caesar Cipher rotation else it just returns the input character 'a', which is useful for preserving non-alphabet input characters such as whitespaces, punctuations etc.

This code works best with English alphabets and does not handle special characters or numbers. It implements ROT13 Caesar cipher rotation which is a special case where the function is its own inverse since the alphabet has 26 characters: ROT13(ROT13(x)) = x.
