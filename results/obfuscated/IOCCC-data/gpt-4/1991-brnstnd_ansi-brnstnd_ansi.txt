This program is an implementation of the esoteric programming language, INTERCAL. It's a code written in C language and it's heavily obfuscated utilizing preprocessor macros and non-trivial control structures. Analyzing obfuscated code is a challenging task particularly when we are dealing with C macros. 

Let's break this down:

1. The main() function starts execution. It initializes several variables and arrays and begins a while loop that continues until the end of file (EOF) condition.

2. The loop checks for a variety of conditions, each associated with a specific character. For example, the code checks to see if the character is a digit (between '0' and '9') and performs an action if it is, and checks to see if the character is equal to different values, each associated with a different action.

3. The code often evaluates mathematical and logical expressions and redirects the program flow as per the output of these evaluations.

4. Macros like Q, P, C, _, g, V, W and several others are used throughout this program. These are defined at the start of this program and used for different purposes, like performing mathematical operations, checking certain conditions, and others.

5. It's also performing string manipulation, creating child process, handling system calls like `open()`, `close()`, `fork()`, `wait()`, `pipe()` etc. 

6. Most of the program's functionality is obfuscated behind a series of macros, making the code hard to read and understand. 

Overall, it appears to be a highly obfuscated code with a complex design, involving string manipulation, complex mathematical/logical operation, filesystem operations and process control. The exact working and purpose of this code would be hard to determine without a proper context and deeper understanding of INTERCAL language as it represents. INTERCAL is purposely different from all other computer languages and was designed to be as different as possible from conventional computer programming languages.
