This is a basic program in the C language. When run, it will print out the string "hello, world!" followed by a newline to the standard output (typically the terminal or console where the program is being run).

Here is a breakdown of the code:
- `#include <stdio.h>`: This is a preprocessor command telling the compiler to include the 'stdio.h' library, which is needed for the `printf` function used in the program.
- `int main()`: This is the main function where the program starts executing. The 'int' denotes that it returns an integer (0 by default in this case).
- `/* a comment */` : This is a comment, which is not executed and is typically used for explaining the code.
- `printf( "hello, world!\n" )`: This is a function that prints the given string to the output. The "\n" within the string is an escape sequence representing a newline, which starts a new line on the output after printing "hello, world!".
  
This program does not take any user input or parameters. It consists of a single, hardcoded print statement.
