The code is a cryptic version of a program that outputs the lyrics of the song "99 Bottles of Beer on the Wall" in C language. The programming technique used here is called obfuscation, which is the practice of making code hard to understand or read. By utilizing recursion in a complex manner, the code is able to execute the loop that prints out each verse of the song. 

The code is highly unreadable due to no clear variable names, heavy use of ternary operators and magical numbers.
