This code is a version of the game Minesweeper written for a Unix-like terminal. It uses curses library for handling the terminal interface. 

Here are the main parts of the code:

1. The chunk starting with `#define O()` defines macros for looping over the grid cells.
2. The function `F()` is used to calculate the number of mines in the neighbors of a given cell.
3. The function `K()` flags the mines surrounding a certain cell.
4. The function `D()` prints the game grid to the terminal.
5. In the main, the game loop is implemented. It reads the inputs, updates the game state, and redraws the screen.

The aim of the game is to clear a rectangular board containing hidden "mines" or bombs without detonating any of them, with help from clues about the number of neighboring mines in each field. 

At the beginning, the terminal window size is adjusted for the game. It loads a saved game if provided, else starts a new one. It then goes into a game loop where it waits for keystrokes, mouse clicks, and performs actions based on those inputs. 

If all mines are successfully flagged or all non-mine cells are successfully opened, the player wins. In this regard, the player loses if he/she opens a cell containing a mine. 

Please note that the `BUTTON1_CLICKED | BUTTON1_RELEASED` used in `mousemask` means the left mouse button click events like click and release will be reported.
