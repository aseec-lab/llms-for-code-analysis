This code appears to be a utility program that reads a file and displays it in a special graphical manner on the terminal window, possibly in a maze-like structure. It's using the ncurses library to manipulate the terminal output. Here are some key points:

1. The program starts by initializing the screen using ncurses functions such as `initscr()`, `raw()`, `curs_set()`, `noecho()`, and `keypad()`. It also creates a new window using `newpad()`. 

2. The file, to be processed, is opened for reading. If no filename is provided as command line argument, it defaults to opening the file "prog.c".

3. The program then reads the file, treating its content as a "map" of some kind. It encodes this map into an integer array `m[256][256]` in a specific manner:

- Space character (' ') gets coded as 0.
- Character '~' gets coded as 64.
- Anything else gets coded as 16.

4. It seems like the map is being interpreted graphically. If a newline character or space is encountered, or if the number of processed characters within a line exceeds 256, the program advances to the next line.

5. If the current lineNumber `y` exceeds 255, the file reading is terminated.

6. Several not fully provided functions - such as `d`, `Z`, `e`, and `c` - seem to manipulate this map. The function `d` appears to create some kind of path on this map and updates display accordingly while `c` processes each direction of a coordinate.

Due to incomplete code, we cannot provide more detailed analysis. And since several aspects of its function - such as what the characters in `char*l` or `Q[]` are representing are not clearly explained, full comprehension of what this code does is difficult.The second part of the code appears to continue the graphical representation process by updating the values at the edges of the 'map' array `m` and sets up a gameplay loop.

1. The nested `for` loops set the borders of the map `m` to the value 16. These border lines will appear different from the main body of the maze according to the values defined earlier.
2. The variables `a`, `b`, and `c` are initialized to 0, and `x` and `y` are initialized to 1.
3. A `do-while` loop begins which will continue as long as the user does not press a certain key. During each iteration:
   - The display of character under the current (x,y) coordinate is updated to a specific ACS character or ASCII character, based on the value in the map `m`.
   - The user input is processed:
      - If `c` is 115, the program attempts to move the pointer downwards.
      - `c` is 119, the program attempts to move the pointer upwards.
      - `c` is 97, the program attempts to move the pointer to the left.
      - `c` is 100, the program attempts to move the pointer to the right.
   - If `c` is 3, the `endwin()` function is called to end the ncurses window and the program exits.
   - If the current `x` or `y` coordinates get closer to the boundaries of the allowed area, the map is moved around to ensure the current location is always visible.
   - The `e(x,y)` function is called, which is not defined in the provided code, but seems related to game element processing.
   - If the current location contains a unique special character (value 64), the loop ends.
4. Once user decides to exit or a unique character is found at the current location, the function `endwin()` is called again to end the ncurses window.
5. The function `cu(Q)` is called, which could possibly be updating the map or game state before wrapping up.
6. A message is printed, with `Q` as the format string and `v` being the count of moves made. 

In conclusion, the code, besides drawing a maze or a landscape inside the terminal, also allows a user to navigate around the landscape, until a unique spot is found or the user decides to quit.
