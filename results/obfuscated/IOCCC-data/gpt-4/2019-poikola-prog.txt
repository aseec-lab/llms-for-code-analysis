This is a complex and obfuscated C program that appears to implement a variety of tasks. 

1. The starting part of the program includes headers for Input/output operations, string operations and file management and directly jumps into a complex series of preprocessor macro definitions. 

2. The program defines a large number of constants, some in very convoluted ways which arguably serve to make the program more confusing.

3. The main function starts by declaring many variables including some arrays and a union, which can hold different data types in the same memory space. It also declares some const pointers and manipulates many of these variables in a variety of ways.

4. After these variable declarations, it continues by opening a file provided on the command line with a file descriptor.

5. It then uses the mmap system call to map files or devices into memory. It is commonly used for input/output efficiency.

6. The program employs loops nested with conditions, bitwise operations, and uses labels to control flow with 'goto' instructions, which is unusual in modern C programming.

7. The program seems to perform some form of cryptography or hashing given all the bit shifting and operations, but the exact functionality is obscured due to extensive use of non-sensical variable names and heavy code obfuscation.

8. It has a label 'laajavuori' which seems to control broader flow of the program. It also references parts of C __DATE__ string to take program control decisions.

9. It also includes segments like 'virpiniemi' and 'vuokatti' where it manipulates and prints strings.

10. There's also a commented URL at the end referring to the International Obfuscated C Code Contest (IOCCC) thus it can be implied this code was most likely designed for that exact purposes - to be as unreadable and complex as possible while still doing something. 

Due to the degree of obfuscation used in the given code, it is difficult to determine the exact functionality without dedicating extensive time and energy. The code is designed to be unreadable and confusing, likely for some form of programming contest or challenge.The remaining part of your program continues the complex bitwise operations observed before, as follows:

1. The program incrementally increases the value of variable 'I' and then prints value of '_' in hexadecimal format.

2. It performs a form of Cyclical Swap operation: where value of 't' is '_+d', value of '_' is 'd', and value of 'd' is 't'. The variable 't' is likely a temporary variable to assist in the swapping of values in order to not lose original data.

3. It then jumps to the 'http' label not included in this part of the code, but inferred to be the part of the main code.

4. Again, we see a multiline comment /*...*/ from the previous section, which mostly seems nonsensical at the first glance potentially alluding to further obfuscation or hidden functionality.

5. The program then finishes with a right brace '}', indicating that the function or scope in question has ended.

However, it's important to note that because of the considerable obfuscation and the incomplete sections of this program, it remains unclear exactly what the functionality of this section of code is within the context of the entire program.
