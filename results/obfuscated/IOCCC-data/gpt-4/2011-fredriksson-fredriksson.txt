This code is in the C language. It seems to contain obfuscation techniques, making it very difficult to understand.

Some visible features of this code:

1. It appears to contain ASCII art in the `p[]` string with many characters that don't make sense in most contexts, perhaps for obfuscation purposes.

2. A function `exit(int)` and `system(char*)` are declared but aren't defined within this code. They are typically used in C standard library for exiting a program and issuing a command to the system shell respectively.

3. The function `main(int _, char**v)` has a few recursive calls to itself (`Q=main`, `Q(_,v)`), changing the parameters each time. The use of recursion may suggest that this program does something iteratively, but it's unclear without context what task it performs.

4. There are conditional statements (`_>(_^_)`, `_==~!_&&i>=(i^i)`, etc) which control the flow of execution. The nature of these statements suggests this program can involve various operations based on the arguments and conditions met.

5. Some file operations are done (`f=fopen(O,"w")`, `fprintf(f,O+~-(~-~!!""*~!!""),...`, `fclose(f)`) suggesting the program might be manipulating or producing files.

However, due to heavy obfuscation and a possible missing part in obfuscated strings, it is very hard to precisely identify what this code does. A plausible interpretation could be that itâ€™s some kind of esoteric/obfuscated code puzzle, a shellcode for a hack, or maybe even something malicious. Detailed analysis would require a lot more effort and understanding of the obfuscation technique used.
