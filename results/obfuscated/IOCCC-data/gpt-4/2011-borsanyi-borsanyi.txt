This is a complex piece of C code that incorporates many different operations. At first glance, it might look obfuscated because of the unconventional formatting, but breaking it down, the operations are as follows:

1. It includes standard libraries `stdio.h` for input/output operations, and `math.h` for mathematical operations.
2. `double a, s` declares two double precision floating point variables.
3. `int n` declares an integer variable. 
4. `p(d t, d M, d x)` declares a function `p` with double precision floating point parameters `t`, `M`, and `x`.
5. `p` function runs recursion with ternary and bifurcation logic. It uses basic mathematical functions such as pow (power function from math.h) and log10 (base-10 logarithm), and also uses the process control function fork() to create child processes.
6. `main(j)` is the main function where `j` is a parameter. The function calls `p` while `j==1` and gets the return value, then outputs a formatted string through `printf`. It also uses 'wait' function which makes the parent process wait till the child process finishes its execution. Then it's recursive calls to `main` with `j*400/n` and `j+1`.
7. `putchar(35-25*!j)&' '&&main(j+1)` is responsible for printing a specific ASCII character to the console (based on calculation) and making a recursive call to `main`.

This code seems to be performing some kind of mathematical analysis through recursion, and then printing specific ASCII characters based on the analysis results. The way it's written also seems to encourage creating multiple child processes. It's quite difficult to understand the exact purpose of this code without clear comments or context due to its complexity and the unconventional style/formatting. It could be some experimental or obfuscated code.
