This code in C is a simple program that prints the statement "howdy!" to the console.

Here's a breakdown of what each line does:

- `#include<stdio.h>`: This line includes the standard I/O library in C, which allows the program to use functions like `printf()` and `scanf()`.

- `#undef FOO`: This line is a preprocessor directive that undefines (removes the definition of) `FOO` if it was previously defined. If `FOO` was not defined before, this line has no effect.

- `#ifndef FOO`: This line is a conditional preprocessor directive. `#ifndef` stands for "if not defined". It checks if `FOO` has not been defined. If `FOO` has not been defined, the code following this directive (up to the matching `#endif`, which is not present in your example) gets compiled.

- `int main() { printf("howdy!\n") }`: This is the `main` function, which is the entry point for the program. This function prints the string "howdy!" followed by a new line (`\n`) to the console.

Please note: The code won't compile due to the missing semicolon (;) at the end of `printf("howdy!\n")`. It should be `printf("howdy!\n");`.
