This code is written in C and when you run this program, it prints the value of pi (Ï€ ~ 3.141593) to the console. The code uses a very unusual way to calculate the value of pi using a very visual algorithm.

You're seeing an Obfuscated C program also known as ASCII art program, a traditional category in the International Obfuscated C Code Contest(IOCCC). Obfuscated C program is C program which is intentionally written to showcase creativity and make the source code harder to understand, often for fun or challenges.

F and OO are integer variables both initialized to 0. There's a square or pyramid of "_-_-_-_" which is macro code shorthand for F-->00||-F-OO--.

F-->00 will decrement F until it is 0 and then the second part will not execute due to short-circuit behavior of OR operator (||). -F-OO-- is decrementing F and OO in such a manner that generates a series of values which when summed up and manipulated in main() through the printf statement gives the value of pi.

This code is essentially a numerical based computation using a series that approximates pi, cleverly disguised in a visually pleasing shape.
