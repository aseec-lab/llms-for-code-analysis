This code appears to be a text-based game that uses the `curses` library to draw to a terminal. 

Here are the major components of the code:

1. `#include <stdio.h>`, `#include <curses.h>`: These are the header files used in the program. `stdio.h` for standard input/output operations and `curses.h` for terminal-based user interface functionalities.

2. `#define` statements: They are macros that replace parts of the code. For example, `#define SRD srand48`, replaces `SRD` in the code with `srand48`, a pseudo-random number generator.

3. `f[3][3] = {15,52,36,20,-39,48,60,0,-25}`: This is a two-dimensional integer array `f` which is initialized with specific values.

4. `nt` and `ci` functions: These functions initialize the 'curses' system, create a window in the terminal, and display initial game elements.

5. `main` function: It's the entry point. It sets up the game, enters a loop to take user inputs, perform the operations, and change the game state depending on the user input. The key instructions include moving and changing (increment and decrement) of elements, and quitting the game.

6. `d` function: The function takes the inputs (represent likely game state/position) and does some operations which affect the game elements' values in the window.

Please note, this code is quite complex to understand due to minimal variable/function names and excessive use of macros for substitution. It's also not well-formatted which adds to the difficulty in understanding. It's not an ideal coding practice to opt for such an obfuscated approach. The code also seems to be incomplete and there might be some undefined behaviors by executing it.
