This is a piece of an obfuscated C program. It's a chess engine written by Harm Geert Muller named Micro-Max, available at http://home.hccnet.nl/h.g.muller/max-src2.html. 

The game inputs moves via the command line and outputs the computer's responses in Standard Algebraic Notation (SAN). It uses -FEN-strings for the board setup and has a simple evaluation with material balance and some positional bonuses. 

It uses setjmp/longjmp for move undoing. The code makes heavy use of the preprocessor and typdefs to compress the source. Additionally, it uses many bitwise operations and other tricks to avoid conditional statements and loops, further shortening the code.

This specific piece includes the main game loop, move generation, evaluation, and move making/unmaking. 

One important note is that it's only part of the program: the necessary header and some important typedefs and definitions, as well as the rest of the logic, are likely elsewhere in the program.
