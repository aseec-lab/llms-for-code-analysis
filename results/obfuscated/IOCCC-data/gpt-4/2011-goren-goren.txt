Based on the provided code snippets, it appears to be a complicated, obfuscated C program. However, it's difficult to give a granular explanation without the entire context. Here's a generalized analysis:

1. `typedef unsigned char t`: This line creates an alias for unsigned char as 't'. 't' can be used instead of unsigned char in code from now on.

2. `Q(a){return(a|-a)>>31}`: This is a function Q that returns either 0 if the integer a is positive, or -1 if a is negative.

3. `H S(c,a){return(H)(a&~c|(int)Ar&c)}`: This function performs bitwise operations on the input.

4. `T(){r="This is not a function\n"}`: This function sets the global variable r to the string "This is not a function\n".

5. `d(){P(O(r)) e('n',p)}`: This function appears to call two other custom functions P and e, using the global variable r and a character 'n' as input.

6. `extern t*ist`: This statement refers to an external variable 'ist'. The type of this variable is t (unsigned char) pointer. 

7. `main(){S(Q(Ar),a)()}`: In the main function, two custom functions Q and S are called and then the result of them is called as a function. 

In conclusion, the provided code seems to encompass a web of function and variable declarations, type definitions, and function calls. The way the code is formatted, especially the missing function signatures and fragmentation, obfuscates its real purpose making it very hard to understand without complete context. It is likely that this is intentional obfuscation, sometimes used in C contests/challenges to create so called "crazy" or intentionally hard to understand code.
