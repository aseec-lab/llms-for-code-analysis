This code appears to be written in an obfuscated and confusing style, making it difficult to understand. Here are some of the aspects of the code I can analyze:

1. There are multiple character arrays (_[] and x[]) defined.
2. There is a string array (av[]) with specific character elements.
3. There are a few integer variables (n, __, i) and pointers (s,t,p).
4. When 'i' becomes zero, it prints out "IBM SUX".
5. It seems to get user input and store it in the character array '_'.
6. It appears to go over the user input, evaluate and process it, and store results in av[] and x[] arrays, possibly resulting in a modified version of input.

Overall, due to the use of non-descriptive variable names, excessive macros, and complex logical conditions, it is incredibly challenging to understand what this code is doing without more context. It would likely require line-by-line testing and debugging to fully understand the intent and function of this code.
