This code does not appears to be written correctly. Here's a few problems:

1. In the global variable declaration section, there should be semicolon at the end of each line which is missing. Correct would be `int O, o, i;`

2. Similarly, declaration of `char* I=""` should end with a semicolon.

3. The function main(l) does not specify the type of the variable `l`.

With these issues, it will throw compile errors and cannot be executed.

Assuming that these issues were resolved, the code appears to aim to implement some sort of text decoder or encoder with usage of bitwise operations and char conversion, but it is hard to tell the exact intent because the given code is not in a cleanly written or comprehensible format. It reads a char from `getchar()`, uses bitwise operations on it and with the results manipulates global variables.

However, please provide the corrected code to give a more specific description of what it does.
