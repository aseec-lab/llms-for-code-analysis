This is a C program script that does quite a few things. It utilizes loops, if conditions, and multiple functions to manipulate and evaluate the user's input in various ways (input parameters seem to be related to geometric coordinates and dimensions). Here is a high-level overview of the code:

1. Define character array `a` and multiple integer/float arrays to store values.

2. Print an initial, likely decorative, line.

3. The do-while loop creates strings made up of space characters and `=` characters.

4. Request user input for two integer variables `r` and `s`.

5. Request user input which is stored in the string `d`.

6. The nested do-while loops read data from input `d`, parsing it into multiple arrays in a pattern. The nested loops are used to manage multi-level data and they look like they're handling a form of graphics or grid-related data and iterating through coordinates.

7. In the next nested do-while loop, if certain conditions are met such as a specific range or matches, it maps characters from `c` array to `a` array. It looks like some form of primitive animation loop, which manages drawing frames based on conditions set by the user's initial input.

8. If there is a difference between two frames of the 'animation', it formats the output to show the changes.

9. It controls the output of animations so that it doesn't exceed a certain limit (`s`), apparently dealing with a method to limit bandwidth or processing requirements.

10. Toggle value of `h`, and loops until time `t` exceeds `r`.

11. Print an ending newline and return 0 (which signifies success in a C program).

Thus, it's an intricate script and could serve as a minimalistic game engine or other graphical representation on a command line interface. The specific purpose or end result would largely depend on the input provided to the program. Unfortunately, the obfuscated coding style and unconventional formatting make it difficult to interpret it in more detail without actual input data.
