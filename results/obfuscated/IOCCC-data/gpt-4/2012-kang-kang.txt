The code is written in C language. However, this code contains several syntax errors (missing semicolons and other punctuation), making it unworkable in its current state. 

Assuming those errors were not intentional and after fixing the missing characters, the code appears to be using bitwise operations and string manipulation to process input from the user or another source.

The variable names are all single characters and thus very difficult to understand; without additional context or comments, it is challenging to determine the practical purpose or function of this code. However, it seems to iterate over an input string, make some calculations and bitwise operations on the ASCII values of the characters, and print out the calculated value in hexadecimal format.

Remember that this is a rough explanation. As the code stands, it wouldn't run due to numerous syntax errors, and there is no clear task present: without more context or corrected code, any explanation will be vague.
