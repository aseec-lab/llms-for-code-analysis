Analyzing each provided chunk of code one by one, 

1. This chunk is defining some preprocessor directives and declaring some variables of different types such as char, int and float. It's also defining three functions named S(), P() and K() but it's not clear from this chunk what exactly these functions are doing.

2. This section has three functions defined - w(), main() and e(). However, the implementation of these functions is split across this and the other chunks, making it difficult to fully understand the purpose of this code.

3. The content of some macros is also tweaked here but once again, the overall context is unclear, making it difficult to piece together what the complete code would do.

The structure of the full code is also convoluted due to the use of pre-processor directives to organize code blocks. This, coupled with the fragmentation of the full code and use of non-descriptive variable and function names, it is not possible to determine the overall purpose of the whole code.

It seems like the main function takes some command line arguments and possibly performs some mathematical operations and/or string manipulations. Moreover, for a complete understanding of the code, it should be provided in a proper and structured way.
