This piece of code, written in C programming language, appears to be designed to handle and evaluate fractions. However, this code is obfuscated, which means it has been deliberately written to be difficult to understand.

Here's a high-level breakdown of what the program does:

1. `#define` statements: These are used to create macros that can replace portions of the code with predefined expressions. 

2. Macro `r(v,a)`: This macro is used to swap and negate v and a if v < 0.

3. Macro `p(v,m, s,w)`: This macro is checking the operand in *c, and if it matches the expected operand, it carries out some calculation, updates some variables and calls main function. This happens for the operators +, -, *, and /.

4. `main` function: It starts by checking *c for various cases: +, -, *, and / converting them to the appropriate form. If it finds a ')', it starts another process and if it finds a digit, it updates 'o' variable. If 2 q is False, it finishes by printing out the fraction in the form "o/O".

5. Recursion & loops: The function 'main' calls itself recursively and the code has several loops. It seems the purpose of this is to process the string (which could be a mathematical expression involving fractions) one character at a time.

Overall, this code appears to implement some kind of fraction calculator. But due to its obfuscation, it is quite challenging to understand its exact functionality without spending significant time deciphering the obfuscated parts.
