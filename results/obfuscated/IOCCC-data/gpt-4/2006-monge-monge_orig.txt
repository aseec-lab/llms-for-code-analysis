The given code is written in C and uses functions from the SDL (Simple DirectMedia Layer) library which is a cross-platform development library to provide low level access to audio, keyboard, mouse, joystick, and graphics hardware. Here's a brief description of main program parts:

1. Several textual arrays, constants and variables have been defined. Among them are width (`W`), height (`H`), and an array (`D[H][W][6]`). This strongly suggests that the code is intended to manipulate an image or draw a graphic interface.

2. It declares two functions: `P(L f)` and `a(L e)`. Both functions extensively use other defined macros (`M(a)`, `h(a,b)`, `J(b)`, `s(_ n)`, `p(L e,_ q,L *t)`) which are significantly complex and handle low level memory operations and specific SDL procedures.

3. In the `main(_ r,L*U)` function, it initializes SDL and sets video mode with defined width and height. Then, it enters an infinite loop, where it looks like checking the mouse state and mutating some elements of array `D[H][W][6]` based on it. If certain keys on a keyboard are pressed or certain events happen, it may break the infinite loop.

4. It also seems to manipulate pixels in a surface (`A=F->pixels`) obtained from SDL and updates it within loops using `SDL_UpdateRect`.

We can infer that the code involves some sort of graphical manipulation based on user input, perhaps an SDL-based painting or drawing application. However, without more explicit variable names or comments, it's challenging to be sure exactly how the program as a whole behaves. It is necessary to run and test the program to determine its exact functionality.
