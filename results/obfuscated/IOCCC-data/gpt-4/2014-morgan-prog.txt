This is a complex piece of C code that appears to handle some kind of complex data manipulation. The code itself heavily uses macros, structs, and some dynamic memory allocation. Unfortunately, the provided code snippet is not complete and only gives a partial view of the program's functionality.

- The `#define` directives at the beginning are defining macros that are replacing commonly used combinations of symbols and code to smaller, single letter symbols.

- There are some functions defined, such as `K()`, `B()`. `C()`, `E()`, `F()`, `I()`, `J()`, and `M()`. Without much context, it's hard to tell what each function is doing.

- The function `K()` is checking if a character is a space, a newline, or a tab.

- The function `B()` appears to be reallocating memory to increase the size of a struct member array and adding an element to this array.

- The code defines a struct `T` with a pointer to itself and various members like `char*a`, `_*b,c,d,e,f`.

- The function `C()` is creating the struct `T` and initializing it's members.

- The function `E()` is splitting a string into an array of words and storing these words into the struct `T`.

- The function `F()` is comparing two struct `T`.

- The function `I()` is forming a string using struct `T`.

- The function `J()` appears to be determining the position of a specific character in a string.

- The function `M()` deals with parsing and tokenizing a string.

- The function `N()` seems to perform some sort of operation on the elements of the struct `T` array.

But the code seems to be incomplete, so it's hard to give a full comprehension of the code. Please provide the whole code to give more accurate results.This code provides the implementations for `O()`, `Q()`, `G()`, and `main()`. 

- `O()` function is used to check if a struct `T` exists in `D e` that matches a given structure; if exists it returns that, otherwise creates a new struct `T`, copies the given struct into that, adds it to `D e`, and finally returns it.

- `Q()` function involves copying data, performing some complex operations with `stat()` on a copied string, possibly updating timestamps. It also makes a recursive call to itself, so it seems to be parsing through nested structs of type `T` too.

- `G()` function is parsing through struct `T` and shifting the bytes whenever a space (`K()`) or tab is encountered. 

- `main()` function is the entry point for the program, which manages program arguments and prepares the environment. Then it reads from the file `p+5`, processes the read data, and performs different actions based on different cases which are distinguished by `switch()` statement. 

Without the broader context or additional comments from the author, it's hard to determine the intention of this code. It appears to be doing some form of complex data processing. The high usage of macros and character manipulation suggests it might be a special-purpose text processor or some sort of interpreter/compiler. Keep in mind that it is generally not good practice to write code in such a cryptic manner, as it may lead to difficulties in maintenance and debugging, and lacks readability for others reviewing your code.
