This is a variation of a "quines" or self-replicating program. However, this code is not written correctly, and it will throw syntax errors if you attempt to compile it.

Here's what the corrected code should look like:

```C
#include <stdio.h>

char a[] = "int main() { printf(\" hello, world!\\n\"); return 0; }";

int main() {
    printf("%s\n", a);
    return 0;
}
```
This will print a piece of C code that prints "hello, world!" when run:

```C
int main() { printf(" hello, world!\n"); return 0; }
```
This technique is similar to a quine - a nonempty computer program that can be run and produce a copy of its own source code as output. They have applications in software testing and more academic aspects of computer science.
