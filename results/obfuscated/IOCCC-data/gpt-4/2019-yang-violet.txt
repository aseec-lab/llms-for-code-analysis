This program is a very obfuscated C program that reads an input file and outputs it in a different format. Its main function is mainly divided into the following parts: read the input file from the command line arguments, transform every single character into different format and save these characters into the memory, and utilize the sorting algorithm to reorder these characters. Some of the transformations seem to include checking and transforming the ASCII of each character, computing some arithmetic calculations, and performing multiple shifts and bitwise operations.

However, due to the obfuscation techniques used like hiding integers, strange use of whitespace and indentation, unnecessary complex expressions, hidden control flows and so on, itâ€™s very hard to understand its comprehensive function just by statically analyzing without running it. Similar to a normal cryptic program, the main purpose of this obfuscated code is to challenge the reader to determine what this program does and how it works.
