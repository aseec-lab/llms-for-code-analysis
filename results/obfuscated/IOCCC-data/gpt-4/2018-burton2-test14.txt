This program is written in the C programming language. It simply prints the string "hello, world!" followed by a line break to the console.

Here's what each line does:

`#include <stdio.h>`: This is a preprocessor command that tells the compiler to include the header file named `stdio.h`. This particular header file is for 'standard input/output', and it lets you use functions like `printf` and `scanf`. 

`int main() {...}`: This is the 'main' function. When you run the program, execution begins at the start of this function.

`printf/*testing*/("hello, world!\n")`: This statement calls the `printf` function, which outputs a string of characters to the console. /*testing*/ is a comment and will be ignored by the compiler. It's sometimes used by developers to annotate their code, in this case it does not change any functionality of the program. The string to be output is "hello, world!\n". The `\n` is an escape character that represents a newline; when the string is printed, a line break will be added at the end.
