This is a highly obfuscated C code. It's hard to understand what this code does because it does not follow standard coding conventions. It seems the code have two preprocessor directives define the same name `c` and `C`, and a large chunk of code inside the main function consists of unintelligible computations with an unreadable format, which is often referred to as "spaghetti code". Additionally, there are numerous instances of unconventional and confusing usage of syntax in this code. 

Here are some assumptions based on the looks of code:

1.  The code seems to take arguments from the command line from `main(int c,char *C[])` .
2.  It seems to manipulate arrays and pointers heavily. These arrays are likely to be strings, inferred from `printf("%c",C)` and arguments of `main`.
3.  The program probably print something out based on manipulation and calculation from the inputs.

Due to the deliberately obfuscated nature of the code, analysing this code without additional contextual information such as variable names, comments, proper formatting and syntax conventions is extremely difficult.
