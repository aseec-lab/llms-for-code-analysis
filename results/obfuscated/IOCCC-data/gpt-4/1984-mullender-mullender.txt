The code given is example of a self-replicating program (often referred to as a "quine"), written as an array of opcode values in C that directly create an executable machine language program.

This particular quine is an example of a Polyglot that can be interpreted as both an x86 machine code program and a valid C program. 

When the program is executed, it prints out itself, including all the opcode array elements in their numeric values. If it is interpreted as a C program, the hexadecimal and octal constants will be printed as decimal values.

Please note that this comes from the historical examples of programming creativity and it would not necessarily represent good software engineering practices. Understanding and maintaining such code is much more difficult, and also these programs can be manipulated to create viruses or malware.
