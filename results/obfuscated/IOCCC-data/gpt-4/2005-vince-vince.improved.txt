The provided code seems to be an obfuscated C program which does the following:

- It interacts with X windows system to create and manage a window.
- It sets up OpenGL for simple 3D rendering, including lighting and texture mapping.
- It reads from a file with the same name as the program (but with ".c" appended) and seems to interpret it as a mix of graphic commands and texture data:
  - It reads the first character of the file until it encounters 'Y' (89 in ASCII).
  - It discards the next two characters.
  - Then it reads the next 1024 characters, interpreting every third character as texture data. For each character 'a', it generates 3 bytes into the texture buffer 'j':
    - The first byte is always 128.
    - The second is 128 if 'a' is a printable ASCII character, otherwise 0.
    - The third byte is equal to the second.
- Afterwards, a texture is created with this data using OpenGL calls.
- Then it reads characters until it encounters 'Q' (81 in ASCII), and ignores the next two characters.
- It expects to read groups of three integers (triplets), each of which defines a vector in 3D space.
- Triples are used to create a list of six quads, possibly defining a 3D object (for example, a textured cube).
- It enters an infinite loop that renders a scene with the constructed object. The object is constantly rotating and moving along the x-axis, and there is logic to flip some lighting parameters upon pressing certain keys. As well as, it continuously controls events from X to react to user input.
- The program terminates prematurely if there's any error setting up X or OpenGL, or if it encounters a non-printable character in the input file. If a precondition is not met, the corresponding error number is printed and the program terminates immediately.

Please note that the source code is highly obfuscated, both layout-wise and by using macro definitions instead of actual function calls or constants, making determining its exact functionality rather difficult.The remaining part of the function appears to be the end of an infinite loop. Here is an explanation of the code:

- `glFlush ()` is an OpenGL command that forces execution of OpenGL commands in finite time. It is used to ensure that previous commands which are buffered should be executed regardless of the state of the command pipeline.
- `glXSwapBuffers(L, w);` is used to promote the contents of the back buffer of a certain window to become the contents of the front buffer. This is useful in double buffering, where one buffer is displayed while the back buffer is rendered to. Once rendering is completed, the buffers are swapped.
- The `l:` appears to be a `goto` label, which would be the target of a `goto l;` statement somewhere in the code.
- `return 0;` will be the final return of the function. Since it is `0`, it generally indicates that the program has finished successfully. If it is included within the main method, it will also indicate to the operating system that the program has terminated without any error.
- The single closing bracket indicates the end of a function or code block. As per given code it may be the end of a main method. 

However, the given code is incomplete and out of context hence it is difficult to provide an exact answer. Further clarifications can be done if full context is provided.
