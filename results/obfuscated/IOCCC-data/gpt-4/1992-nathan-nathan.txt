The given code is written in C and it prints a set of strings to the standard output (usually the terminal).

Here is a summarised explanation of the code:

1. It declares and initializes a static array `text` of character pointers (essentially an array of strings). The strings contain information about the export regulations of a program in the United States.

2. It defines the main function which is the entry point of the program.

3. Inside the main function, it declares a pointer to a character pointer `ptr`.

4. After that, a `for` loop is used to iterate over the static `text` array.

5. In each iteration of the loop, the current string is printed to standard output using the `printf` function.

6. The loop continues until a null value is encountered in the text array (signifying the end of the array).

7. Finally, the function returns 0 indicating that the program has ended successfully. 

Please note that your code is not correctly formatted. The semicolon at the end of the statements and comma at the end of the array declaration are missing which would result in syntax errors in C.
