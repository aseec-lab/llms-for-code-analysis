The provided code is written in C and seems to be interfacing with the Perl interpreter to create a simple reverse Polish notation (RPN) calculator. Reverse Polish notation is a mathematical notation in which every operator follows all of its operands.

Here is a summary of what the code does:

1. Via the Perl interpreter, it allows you to do simple arithmetic calculations in reverse Polish notation which includes addition(+), subtraction(-), multiplication(*), and division(/).
2. The major part of the program is a Perl script that handles the RPN calculations, while the smaller part is the C code that embeds the Perl interpreter and passes a Perl script to it. 
3. The macros, `qq`, `cc` and `ZZ` defined at the start are being used throughout the code.
4. The Perl script starts with reading a line, checks if it is a number or mathematical operator then performs calculations - including checking for any errors like divide by zero.
5. The calculations are performed by fetching the top two numbers from the stack (`@SS`) and then applying the operator.
6. The results are pushed back onto the stack.
7. If it is not a number, it treats it as a mathematical operator and tries to apply it. 
8. The available mathematical operations seem to be: addition, subtraction, multiplication and division.
9. This script also includes several messages such as "stack empty", "divide by zero" that get printed under certain conditions.
10. Finally, after everything is done, the program exits.

It is interesting to note that the code uses `newXSproto` function to create new XSUB's. XSUB's is a way of writing Perl subroutines in C, allowing Perl program to call C functions.

However, there's a point to consider that, the code appears abstract and not totally reader-friendly which is indicative of its purpose, it might serve as a clever piece of obfuscated code, such code is often used in programming contests/challenges and is meant to be hard to understand. 

In conclusion, while the code is difficult to understand due to obfuscation practices, it serves as a reverse Polish notation calculator incorporating Perl into C.
