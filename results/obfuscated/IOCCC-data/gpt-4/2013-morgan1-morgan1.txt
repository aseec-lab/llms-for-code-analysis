This code appears to be written in C and is a program for drawing the orbits of planets in our solar system using X11 library of C and drawing arcs on a window. 

The planetary data, starting year, month and day etc. are encoded as characters in a string `n`. The rest of the code calculates the position of each planet for each day specified, then draws it on an X window that it creates.

The user can interact with the program via keypad keys (Up, Down, Left, Right) adjusting the date displayed by moving forward or backward in time in increments.

This script likely requires the X11 library to be installed and functioning on the host system, and would run on an Unix-like operating system, as Windows does not typically have this library available.
