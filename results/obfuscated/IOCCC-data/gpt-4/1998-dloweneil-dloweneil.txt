This is a fairly complex and obfuscated implementation of a game similar to Tetris but with its own unique rules. Let's break it down:

At a high level, this program generates a 2-dimensional grid or gameboard using a characters array `L`, whose dimensions `X` and `Y` are either provided as command-line arguments or defaulted to 15 and 12, respectively. If provided, they must be more than 6 and less than 98.

The play area is populated with tiles represented by different characters from the string `C = "POOT"`. Each character tile is located at a random position on the grid initially and then it moves in a straight line until it hits a wall or another tile. Once the tile stops, the score increments, another random character tile is chosen, and the play resumes.

The program listens for keyboard inputs. Pressing 'a' moves the insertion point of new tiles counterclockwise along the edge of the play area. Conversely, pressing 's' moves the insertion point clockwise. 

As the tiles pile up on the grid, the game checks for alignments of tiles. If it finds 4 sequential tiles of the same character in any direction, it tags these tiles by adding 9 to the ASCII value of the tile character (which appears not to affect their displayed value), doubles the score for each quadruple found, and causes these tiles to sink towards the bottom of the grid. 

Finally, the updated score and game grid are displayed, the program pauses, and then continues to display the updated state of the game grid with each cycle until the program is terminated.

Note: The game does not appear to have a winning or losing condition.It appears that you've included part of some code, but there's not enough context to provide a comprehensive response. This code stub includes the end of multiple nested loops or conditionals, a defined function or macro `D` with parameter `c`, and probably a label `R` to which program control may jump to using `goto`.

However, without the full context of preceding part of the function, it's difficult to provide any concrete information. Kindly, provide more code and context for a more accurate response. 

Also, note that using `goto` can make code difficult to read and manage, so it's generally discouraged in modern programming except in a few exceptional cases.
