This C language code snippet is what is commonly referred to as "obfuscated code", in which the code is deliberately written to be very difficult to understand.

1. The main function is defined with two parameters, v and c. It is unusual in C to define main in this way, as main is typically defined as `int main(int argc, char** argv)`. However, here v is the number of command line arguments (replacing argc) and c is an array of command line argument strings (replacing argv).

2. The code begins an infinite loop because its condition is not specified.

3. The `for` loop essentially cycles through the command line arguments.

4. It replaces the first argument with the string "Hello, world!\n".

5. If no arguments are provided (i.e., v and c are 0), it attempts to run an executable file that is specified by the name stored in the variable *c (which is the command line argument), with the rest of the command line arguments as arguments. The `execlp` function replaces the current process image with a new process image.

6. If an argument was actually provided, it tries to invert the argument by using the negation (!) operator twice. 

7. The `write` function writes the string 'Hello, world!\n' to the first command-line argument.

This code is not functional, and running it may lead to unexpected actions or a crash. It is also quite hard to figure out any useful, legitimate functionality from this obfuscated code snippet. 

Please note that writing or running this kind of code is not recommended as it is difficult to understand and may lead to undefined behavior or security vulnerabilities. Code should always be written with clarity and maintainability in mind.
