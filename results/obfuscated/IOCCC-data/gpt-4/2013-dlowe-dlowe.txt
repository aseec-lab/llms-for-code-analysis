The given code is written in C language. It's quite uncommon and cryptic mainly because of its syntax usage and missing parts. It seems like the code is not fully provided here. The function _(e) for instance is not defined in the provided code snippet.

However, based on my interpretation to this part of the code:

- Parameters are passed to the main function (a and b) where 'a' probably represents the number of arguments and 'b' is an array to the argument strings.

- It declares three integer variables c, d and e and performs some operations on them based on a for loop. The objective of the loop is not clear without the full context but its content suggests that it compares an unknown function _(e) results for different values.

- The while loop is used to print certain characters based on computations of the _ function results. 

It's hard to accurately determine what this code does as it seems incomplete and some functions are not clear or defined. It would be far more understandable with the rest of the code.
