This code seems to be obfuscated and it is not clear what it is intended to do without context like variable initialization, use and scope.

At a glance, it seems that after multiple mathematical operations and 'if' conditions over the provided input O, it finally returns a value of 8 + O modulo 4. The code contains complex and unorthodox computations which make it extremely difficult to state the code's purpose without an understanding of the context in which it's used.

The chunk O+="has dirtiest IF"[(I/-Q&12)-l/Q%4] seem to be attempting to perform some kind of string manipulation, but this code won't compile as it's currently written because of the mixed use of O as both integer and string types.

Also, this line if(Q*=2)O+="has dirtiest IF"[(I/-Q&12)-l/Q%4] has a bitwise and operator '&' which is a binary operator and is used to compare two bit patterns and generates resultant bit pattern.

Overall, I can only make speculations without running the code and knowing its context of use. The code requires additional context in order to provide a thorough analysis.

Additionally, the syntax of the code seems to be incorrect.
