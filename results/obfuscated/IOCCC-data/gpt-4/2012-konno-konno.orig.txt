This piece of code is written in C -- a widely used general-purpose programming language, more specifically in obfuscated C. It is a type of code where the syntax is correct but extra characters or altering usual code patterns are added to make the code more difficult to read, decode and comprehend. 

The functionality of this code is a bit tricky to understand due to the usage of bitwise operations. The `main` function is called recursively.

Here's the basic walk-through of its execution:

1. The command-line argument `l[1]` is converted to an integer using `atoi()`
2. This integer is then bit-shifted to the right by a variable number of places, derived from calculations based on `O` and `o`.
3. The least significant bit of the large number is selected.
4. The whole expression `(1&(o?o:O)|O*2)` is carefully designed to produce a sequence of 0 and 1's.
5. The output is made of 35's and 32's (respectively '#' and ' ') based on comparisons and conditions, thereby producing an ASCII-art representation of the passed number.

Please note that it is significantly hard to understand the exact output without a proper context or inputs. It's a part of obfuscated C program which is designed to be hard to understand and sometimes used to showcase the complexity and flexibility of C language.
