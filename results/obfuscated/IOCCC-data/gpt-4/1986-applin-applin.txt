This is a polyglot code (the same code can be interpreted by multiple programming languages).

The `cat =13 /*/ >/dev/null 2>&1` is shell command trying to redirect the output into '/dev/null' (a special file that automatically discards all its input). However, this command has been commented out because there is no space between `=13` and `/*/`. In UNIX shell, `&>filename` is shorthand for `>filename 2>&1`, which means "redirect both stdout and stderr to the file filename".

`echo "Hello, world!"` will output "Hello, world!" in shell.

`exit` will terminate the shell.

`main()` is the primary function that would be run in C language. Inside it, the `write()` function is used. `write()` is a system call that can be used to write data to a file descriptor; it has three arguments - file descriptor, pointer to buffer from where to write, and number of bytes to be written.

`cat-~-cat` is an expression with the bitwise complement operator `~`, which inverts all the bits of its operand.

`putchar(~-~-~-cat)` is a C statement that prints a character determined by the expression `~-~-~-cat`. 

The last part of the code (`,)') end */`) seems to be a commented-out part of Fortran code.

Note:

This code may not run as expected, since it seems to be a mix of different languages and also including some commented section that may puzzle the interpreter/compiler to understand it correctly.
