The given code is meant to be a C program that uses ASCII escape sequences to display an animation in a terminal. 

At a high level, it first retrieves the size of a terminal window and then uses this information to display an animation based on that size using `printf` and escape sequences, along with extensive use of mathematical functions for procedural generation.

Let's break it down:

1. `ioctl(0, TIOCGWINSZ, &a)`: 
This line makes a call from a special interface called ioctl() that allows the programmer to control device parameters of Unix-originated devices. In this case, we are asking for the terminal size. The 'TIOCGWINSZ' is a constant for the command that gets the window size. The result is placed into an array `short a[4]`.

2. The following lines set up a range of variables both integer and float for use in the animation.

3. The main animation loop starts with `while (printf("\x1b[H\x1B[?25l"),!usleep(79383))`. 
   This line is using 'printf' to send 2 escape sequences to the terminal:
   - `\x1b[H` sets the cursor position to home (upper left). 
   - `\x1B[?25l` hides the cursor. 

4. Inside the loop, it's using mathematical functions to calculate what character to display and where based on the terminal window size and the current position in the animation.

5. The 'usleep(79383)' call is used to pause execution for roughly 79,383 microseconds, or approximately 0.08 seconds, between each frame of the draw update.

6. Once the terminal size changes beyond a certain limit, the direction of movement of the animation (variable 'p') flips.

This code appears to be obfuscated, probably for a code golf competition or just for fun. Here, readability of code is intentionally compromised for the sake of achieving a shorter program length or some other measures of 'efficiency'.
