This is a recursive C code. However, this code is obfuscated - deliberately made to be difficult to read and understand. 

The purpose of code obfuscation can be either playful, to create something that is challenging and interesting to reverse-engineer, or malicious, to prevent or slow down the process of understanding what the code does. 

This code has not specified a return type for function main and the functionality is not clearly defined so it's challenging to determine what this code does. More precisely, it has a recursive call hidden behind numerous ternary and bitwise operations. 

Commonly, the main function is written as `int main(int argc, char **argv)`. In this code, instead of argc and argv, the arguments are defined as I, O, O0, OO and l. 

The recursive calls to `main` function within the code and the use of arguments passed to it indicate that the code is likely performing some complex calculation, depending on the command line arguments that it was run with.

Although it's challenging to discern exactly what the functionality of the program is, the `atoi` function (from standard library stdlib.h) in the code indicate that this obfuscated code likely converts some string arguments into integers for its internal computations.

The `printf` function is used to print something but due to multiple arithmetic operations before this function call, it's difficult to determine what values it prints. 

It seems like some command-line arguments have been fed into the atoi() function for conversion into integers, but the lack of clarity makes it difficult to definitively identify the purpose of this code. It could potentially be a computing function, mathematical puzzle, or some kind of decoding program. The code will require thorough debugging or reverse engineering to fully understand.
