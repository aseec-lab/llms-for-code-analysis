This is a simple C program which outputs the text "hello, world" followed by a new line. It's the most basic program for beginners to start learning about C programming.

Although the comment at the start of the program states "word count incorrect except with -k", there's no context or code within the program that can be understood or analyzed in this regard. And likewise, the comment about "view output with no args" doesn't make any particular difference to running this program since it doesn't take any arguments anyway.

As a reminder, comments are ignored by the compiler and are usually used by programmers to make notes or explain what the code does. In this case, the comments seem out of place or irrelevant to the context.

However, here is the fixed and properly formatted code :

```c
/* This program prints "hello, world" */
#include <stdio.h>

int main(){
    printf("hello, world\n");
    return 0;
}
```

When the code is run, it will display "hello, world" on the console.
