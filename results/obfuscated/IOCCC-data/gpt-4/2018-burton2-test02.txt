The first block of code is a command line operation. This code is written in C and does the following:

1. It takes command line arguments. av[0][0] fetches the first character of the first argument. If the first character is a double quote ("), it further checks the next character.
2. If the second character of the first argument is 'a', it prints "a" to the console. If the second character is 'b', it prints "b" to the console. If it's any other characters, nothing will happen because there are no other cases in the switch statement.
3. Afterward, it enters a loop that prints the remaining argument count in reverse order (not including av[0]) to the console until all arguments have been accounted for.
4. It then returns 0, indicating successful execution of the program. 

This code does not have a valid ending syntax (semicolon or closing brace), which may cause a syntax error.

The second code block is more straightforward. It's a simple program that when run, prints "hello, world" to the console. This block of code is often the first program learned by people when they are starting to program in C language.
