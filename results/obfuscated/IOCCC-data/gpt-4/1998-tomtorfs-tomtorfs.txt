This code is cryptic and formatted in an unusual way which makes it more difficult to understand. After several checks and processing, it seems to be a type of file encryption program. Here is a rough analysis:

- In `main`, it receives command line arguments. If the number of arguments is not equal to 7, the program immediately returns 1 (indicating an error).
- It opens a binary file whose name is provided as the second argument (`1[A]`) in read mode.
- It then initializes an array `b` of unsigned long with 8 elements. This array is used both to store the command line arguments (converted to unsigned long) and also during the file processing. 

The rest of the code seems to perform following operations:

- Reads the binary file character by character.
- Performs bitwise operations on the read character and the values in array `b`.
- Repeats this operation until end of file is reached.

It ends:

- by closing the binary file,
- printing some kind of result, likely a checksum or hash code, obtained from the last operations.
- returning 0, which typically denotes a successful program termination in C programming.

Please note this is a rough and high level explanation as there seems to be a lot of bitwise manipulation and cryptic code which would need a more detailed and thorough analysis to understand precisely operation by operation.
