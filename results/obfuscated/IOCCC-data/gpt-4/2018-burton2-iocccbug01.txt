The code specifies a simple program in C, which would print "howdy!" to the screen.

However, the part "/*/int if while -- how many keywords?/*/ " is in a block comment, so it doesn't contribute to the functionality of the program. It seems to be a question asking how many keywords are in it, to which the answer is 3 ('int', 'if', and 'while').

The main function does not specify a return type which should be 'int' according to the best coding practices so it'll cause a compilation error in strict compiler settings. 

There's also a missing semicolon at the end of printf statement. Correct version would be "printf("howdy!\n");". Without it, the program would fail to compile. 

Therefore, this code appears to be incomplete or written with syntax errors.
