This code is a C program implementation of the SHA-1 cryptographic hash function. Following functionalities inform so:

1. It defines an array `h[20]` of 32-bit unsigned integers. The SHA-1 cryptographic hash function produces a 160-bit (20-byte) hash, each element of the `h[]` array will hold 8-bits (1-byte) of the final hash digest.
   
2. The four variables `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d` are used in the main hashing loop of the SHA-1 algorithm.
   
3. It reads the input data a byte at a time by calling `getchar()`, and constructs the 512-bit blocks to be hashed.
   
4. The nested for loop is the primary operation loop where the compression function is performed which includes hash update and calculations.

However, the readability of this program is atrocious. With a lot of variables being single letters, and the usage of bitwise operators, and extremely long and complex expressions, this code is not easily understandable.

It also contains platform-specific code for Windows inside the `#ifdef _WIN32` preprocessor directive to set the mode of the standard input stream to binary. The rest of the code is same for other platforms.

Although this code might work properly and efficiently but due to the poor readability and maintainability of such code, it is not recommended programming practice.
Please note: In case there's few more lines of this code, some additional features may get added to it.
