The code seems to be written in C language. It consists of several constant macros and function definitions. However, the arrangement of the code is fairly untraditional and inconsistent, making it hard to read and understand.

1. Firstly, several macros for memory allocation, file reading, and memory deallocation are defined (M, R, E).

2. The second macro "R" reads "Z*w" elements of size "float" from the binary file into an array "x", where "Z" and "w" are defined later in the code.

3. The function "F" calculates a value based on its three integer inputs and the value of a character in the string "G". This string seems to be used as a look-up table.

4. Function "T" is a recursive method that updates an element of an array "L" based on a calculation involving the input parameters. This function returns an integer.

5. Function "f" does some computation on an integer input "x", involving array "L" and "s".

6. Function "C" does some computations on arrays "h" and "i", and several mathematical operations.

7. Function "d" writes some data to a file after performing some computations. It generates an output using a series of floats and integers.

8. The "main" function is starting the program and seems to accept command-line arguments. It also seems to exploit file handling operations with the potential of reading multiple files. And it seems to use standard input (stdin) and standard output (stdout) for data storage and presentation. 

This code is complex and hard to understand without knowing the context. Therefore a definitive explanation of this code can't be given. It would be helpful if the names of variables and the structure of the code were more descriptive and conventional. Noteworthy, such style can be a consequence of the need to minimize the code size in certain situations, or it could be used as a form of obfuscation, whether for security reason or code golfing kind of challenge.
