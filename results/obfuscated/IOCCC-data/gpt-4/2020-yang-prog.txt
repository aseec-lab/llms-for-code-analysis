This is a cryptic piece of code with compact and obfuscated structure. This makes it quite difficult to understand exactly what it does, but here is an overview:

1. This code appears to be written in the C programming language. It includes the headers (stdio.h, stdlib.h, and time.h) necessary to do input/output operations, handle time values, and general purpose functions, respectively.
2. There are lots of defined variables of different types (integer and character pointer) and few helper functions (O, Q) that are being used in main.
3. This code is making intensive use of exploits in the C language syntax to make the code more compact, such as the ternary operator (?:), comma operator (,) and modulus operator (%), making the code hard to read and understand.
4. Through the various functions defined (O, Q), it seems to conduct a labyrinth of operations involving bitwise shifting, logical operations, and calculations with random numbers, handling character strings, etc.
5. The main function demonstrates conditional checks, random number generation, character operations, bitwise operations and calls other helper functions.
6. Also, it seems to be handling some files(input/output operations) as per the code line "EOF   -(i=   getchar())" 

Without a context, guessing the application of this code is hard, although it might be a part of a cryptographic algorithm, a code obfuscation technique, or even some type of puzzle or coded message due to its convoluted and cryptic structure and operations. Handling it without sufficient knowledge about its origin and purpose might not be advisable.
