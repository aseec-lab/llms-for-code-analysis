This code resembles a type of "Obfuscated C Code", which means that it is written in such a way to make it hard to understand.

The code looks like it is meant to display some type of graphical effect. The exact nature of the effect is difficult to determine due to the obfuscation. However, we can break down some of its components:

- A number of variables, arrays and pointers are defined at the start, with some undefined macros.

- There are conditional defines that include different libraries depending on the compilation environment (__DJGPP__, SDL or curses).

- One function "F" is defined that behaves differently depending on whether it is compiled with DJGPP, SDL or curses.

- The main function begins by initializing the "F" function, followed by a set of calculations. These calculations seem to involve trigonometric and geometric transformations.

- The final part of the main function appears to involve a graphical calculation and display operation. This involves trigonometric functions, possibly some form of wave or oscillation calculation.

- UPDATED CODE ($): Throughout the code, certain mathematical transformations with geometric entities are performed. The variables are initialized and then are used to carry out these transformations. A noteworthy point is that throughout the code, there are multiple instances that seem to generate some sort of cyclic or recurring effect, most likely a sinewave pattern.

Again, given the obscurity of the code, its true workings and intentions are difficult to ascertain with certainty. Unveiling its entire working would require a detailed walk-through of the code, which isn't quite feasible given that certain chunks seem to be missing from the provided code.
