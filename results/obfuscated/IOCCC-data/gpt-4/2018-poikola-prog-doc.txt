The provided code is a highly obfuscated and stylized piece of C code. It does several things but, overall, it appears to output some type of secret encrypted message based on certain conditions. 

Here are some operations the code performs:

1. It does some computations involving date and time.
2. It uses a lot of bitwise operators, likely for some cryptographic or encoding purposes.
3. With the usage of `getdelim` function, it seems to be reading from a file or similar stream likely till it encounters a null character (`'\0'`).
4. It seems to generate some sort of animated output on the terminal by using escape sequences for terminal colouring and clearing the screen. 
5. It checks some conditions on the current date (possibly matching with a specific hardcoded date) and then outputs some encrypted string message `I[]`.
6. It has a cryptographic checksum, which it checks against `s`. If the checksum does not match, it will goto `a4_` label and ends the program.

However, due to heavy obfuscation (comprising the usage of macros, hexadecimal numbers and cryptic calculations), it is quite challenging to understand exactly what the output would be and under which conditions it is triggered without executing the code.
