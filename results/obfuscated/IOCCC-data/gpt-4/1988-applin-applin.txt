This appears to be a type of pseudocode or structured English that instructions have been generated for (like assembly or machine language). However, it seems it is not a standard programming language. Without context information or a key to interpret these instructions, it's impossible to determine what exactly it does.

The 'I' and 'U' characters could denote initialization and 'uninitialization' actions respectively. 'L' could signify start of a loop, 'E' might represent end of a scope or an exit point, 'D' could stand for declaration of a variable and 'F' for creating a condition guideline. 'R' may relate to including some library (in this case, stdio.h). However, these are all assumptions given the obscured code representation. For an accurate interpretation we would need more information and context.
