This code is quite obfuscated and written in a non-standard style to make it difficult to read and understand. Here's a basic breakdown:

1. `#define C_C_(_)` is a macro that applies bitwise operation AND with the inverted space character (`' '` ASCII value 32) and the variable passed.

2. `#define _C_C(_)`  is a macro that represents a boolean expression that compares a fixed bitwise operation between an ASCII backspace ('\b') and the value `C_C` with ASCII values of tab ('\t') and a newline ('\n')

3. `#define C_C _|_` is a macro to perform a BITWISE OR operation in the provided argument.

4. `#define b *` is redefining * as b.

5. `#define C /b/` this redefine seems to be a representation for division by b.

6. `#define V _C_C(` starts the macro that called previously defined macro _C_C.

The `main` function takes two arguments (unnamed) and creates two character variables, `_` and `__`. It repeatedly reads a character from standard input, transform it using macro functions, and writes it to the standard output until it ends.

The `subr` function is defined taking a pointer to a char `C`. It creates a hardcoded string and iteratively performs similar read-transform-write operations.

However, it's hard to point out the exact working or purpose of the code due to its obfuscated nature, or if it even compiles and runs successfully due to syntax errors present. Symbols such as `/b/` and `'\b'b'\b'` are strange and do not conform to typical C syntax. 

Given that this code is written in an obfuscating manner, it's hard to say definitively what it does without executing or testing it. This level of obfuscation is sometimes used maliciously to hide nefarious activities in seemingly innocuous code. It's also sometimes used as a kind of puzzle or test of programmers' skills. I would advise not to run such code unless you fully understand it or trust the source.
