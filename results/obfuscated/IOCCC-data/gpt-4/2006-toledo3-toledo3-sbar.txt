The code is in C language, it's a very cryptic implementation of a small chess game. The code does its job by utilizing ASCII art, X11 graphics, bitos, and some other interesting techniques.

Let's break down what some lines do:

1. The code starts by including the X11 library, which is a library in UNIX systems and its derivatives like Linux for drawing graphics. The programmer then declares some strings of characters which will later be used to represent the state of the chessboard.

2. It defines a main function that initializes a chess game. The window for the game is created using a simple call to `XCreateSimpleWindow`.

3. The chess board is drawn and pixelated using `XCopyPlane`.
   
4. It uses bit manipulation to set the properties of the board, such as setting pieces into correct positions and moves set pieces around the board.

5. It also handles user interactions (mouse clicks and moves).

6. The chess game also uses a simplistic AI algorithm for handling moves of the enemy player. The AI is rather basic and does not have any advanced tactics or strategies. It simply chooses a move at random from the set of all possible moves.

7. The chess game ends when a king is captured or when there are no more valid moves left to be played.

In general, this code is hard to understand due to its use of very cryptic and compact coding style. It lacks good practices such as documentation, separation of concern, and readability â€“ but it's fascinating in its own minimalist way!
